INTERPRETATION:
A variant of uncertain clinical significance was detected in this individual. The interpretation of this result is summarized
below.
The c.2886T>G variant in MSH6 causes an amino acid substitution, which replaces isoleucine with methionine at position
962. It was identified in 1/250010 (0.0004%) of alleles tested from control populations in the Genome Aggregation
Database (gnomAD). To the best of our knowledge, it has not been previously reported in the literature. The lle962
residue is weakly conserved in evolution. In silico analysis programs (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Mutation Taster) predict this
variant to be tolerated. This variant is listed in ClinVar (VCV000483847). In our opinion, the evidence collected to date is
insufficient to firmly establish the clinical significance of this variant; therefore it is classified as a variant of uncertain
clinical significance.
Please refer to the ClinVar database for further information about this variant(s). If a formal variant re-evaluation is
required, please contact our laboratory.
No other clinically relevant sequence variants or large deletions or duplications were detected in the genes tested (see the
Test Details section). Although no other pathogenic variants have been found, as the analytical sensitivity of this analysis
based on results of validation studies performed by our laboratory is ~99%, it is possible that a pathogenic variant not
detectable by these assays is present in one of these genes In addition, as this test does not detect all clinically significant
variants associated with this disorder, it is also possible that a pathogenic variant in another gene not tested is present in
this individual.
Genes included in this panel are associated with an increased risk for certain types of hereditary cancers. While the
majority of cancers occur sporadically, a proportion may be due to inherited pathogenic variants in genes associated with
cancer. Pathogenic variants in these genes are associated with an increased susceptibility to certain malignancies,
autosomal recessive conditions, and may cause other non-cancer related symptoms. It is important to note that not all
individuals with a pathogenic variant will develop cancer. Genetic testing of at-risk first degree relatives should be
considered once identification of a variant has occurred in a proband. The reproductive implications of being a carrier of a
pathogenic variant should be discussed with an appropriate health care professional. Genetic counselling is recommended
concerning the implications of these results to this individual and this individual's family.
This assay is based on the current state of knowledge of the genetic basis of this disorder and designed to identify
constitutional genetic changes in the tested genes/loci (see Test Details). The possibility of null alleles due to rare family
specific variants in the primer/probe binding sites cannot be completely ruled out. Family relationships are assumed as
stated and no attempt has been made to verify these relationships. Laboratory results are subject to approximately 0.5%
error in any of the pre-analytical, analytical or post-analytical phases of the test [Clin.Chem(48(5):691-698].
Methodology Used
Next Generation Sequencing HEREDITARY BREAST AND OVARIAN CANCER 18 gene panel, HOXB13 c.251G>A
(p.Gly84Glu) variant sequencing, and MLPA for a subset of genes

Test Details
Genes analyzed: ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, EPCAM*, HOXB13^, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, STK11, TP53
Genomic DNA is enriched for targeted regions using custom designed capture probes (KAPA HyperChoice) and a
hybridization-based protocol (KAPA HyperPlus Custom Library, KAPA Biosystems-Roche) followed by next generation
sequencing (NGS) on a NextSeq platform (Illumina). Read alignment and single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small
insertion/deletions (indels) calling are performed using NextGENe software (SNP/INDEL analysis, SoftGenetics). SNVs
and indels within coding exons and 20 bps flanking regions are analyzed. Certain known likely pathogenic or pathogenic
variants outside these regions are also included in the analysis (for a complete list please contact our laboratory). Exonic
deletions and duplications in all targeted genes (except PMS2) are called using an in-house copy number variant (CNV)
analysis algorithm (PMID 27376475). Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is performed for CNV
analysis for PMS2 Note that some MLPA kits used as part of this test may contain probes for genes or variants that are
not included in our test panels, which could result in incidental findings. All reported variants are confirmed by a second
technology including Sanger sequencing, MLPA, long range PCR, or qPCR. Based on validation study results, this assay
achieves >99% analytical sensitivity and specificity for SNV, indels <10bp in length and exonic deletions and duplications;
however, sensitivity for indels larger than 10bp but smaller than a full exon may be reduced This assay is not designed
and validated for detection of mosaicism. The following genes and corresponding exons are prone to misalignment due
to
presence of highly homologous regions in the genome, and therefore, are at increased risk of false results: ATM exon 28,
CHEK2 exons 11-15, PTEN exon 9 and PMS2 exons 1-5, 9, 11-15 (PMID 27228465). Variant nomenclature is based on
the Human Genome Variation Society guidelines. Variant interpretation and classification is based on published guidelines
(PMID 25741868). Only pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variants of uncertain clinical significance are reported.
