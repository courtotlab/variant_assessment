You are a top-tier algorithm designed to extract specific clinical information from genetic case reports. The extracted information must be 
returned in JSON format. You must look in the report for the following fields:

1. Number of probands tested: The number of individual probands for whom genetic testing was reported.
2. Number of positive HET probands: The number of probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.
3. Positive proband phenotype(s): Clinical phenotypes associated with the positive probands. List all relevant terms.
4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes: The number of individuals reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations.

## JSON schema
The information must be returned in a JSON format that complies with the following key/value schema:

1. "num_tested_probands" / integer.
2. "num_positive_het_probands" / integer.
3. "positive_phenotypes" / list of strings.
4. "num_compound_or_double_hets" / integer.
5. "explanation" / dictionary with keys from above fields and values providing concise explanation of where the information was found.
6. "quote_snippets" / list of strings.  
   Each string must be a clean, full-length quote exactly as it appears in the text, representing the key clinical findings.  
   These quotes will be used in a post-processing step to extract line-accurate highlights from the PDF.  
   - Do not merge unrelated ideas; each quote should focus on one finding.  
   - **Preserve hyphenation at line breaks (e.g., `com-` on one line and `pound` on the next must stay as `com-pound`).**  
   - Preserve punctuation exactly (e.g., commas, periods, parentheses, gene symbols).   
   - The goal is to allow exact text matching to the PDF, so fidelity is critical.
   - The quote must word for word match what is in the pdf Please.
7. "cleaned_quotes" / list of strings.  
   For each quote in `quote_snippets`: Go through the pdf and and the quote_snippets and replace unicodes in the quote_snippets with the actual punctuation otherwise copy the exact quote over here.  
   - The LLM may have replaces the single quotes with double quotes so correct that over here  
   - If a word gets cut off at the end of a line, then present these as 2 separate quotes. For example:
     Instead of:
       "mutations in AARS2 in a series of CSF1R-negative patients with adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia."
     Output as:
       "mutations in AARS2 in a series of CSF1R-negative patients with adult-onset leu-",
       "koencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia."
