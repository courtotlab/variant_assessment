## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The text refers to "a subject" and "a 6-year-old girl" suggesting that only one proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability and who was considered during several years as having a non-progressive encephalopathy. At the age of six years, she had an epileptic seizure which was treated with sodium valproate. In the months after treatment was started, she developed acute liver failure and severe progressive encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)." This suggests that the proband is compound heterozygous for two pathogenic variants in WARS2.

1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The text continues to refer to "the proband" and "she," suggesting that only one proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents. Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intra-uterine growth retardation... When examined at the age of eleven months, severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs were noticed and she was found to have slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum... When seen at eighteen months of age, a severe delay of cognitive and motor development was confirmed... At six years of age, she was hospitalized because of a long lasting episode with decreased awareness, lateral eye deviation and twitching of the eyelids at the left... She was diagnosed with acute liver failure (ALF) and metabolic encephalopathy... During the next months, episodes with decreased awareness occurred more frequently... Her neurological condition further deteriorated... She passed away at home at the age of 6 ½ year."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836). The first variant (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10) was a single nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift and premature stopcodon. The second variant (c.938 A > T, p.Lys313Met) was a missense variant." This confirms that the proband is compound heterozygous for two pathogenic variants in WARS2.

INFERRED: The text continues to refer to "the proband" and "she," suggesting that only one proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a 6-year-old child with WARS2 deficiency. The proposita had presented at young age with developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability. Her condition remained stable for several years until she presented for the first time with seizures at the age of six years and a treatment with sodium valproate was initiated. During the next month, her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and ultimately she developed acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

INFERRED: The text mentions "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity." and "Sanger sequencing of DNA from the mother, revealed that she is a carrier of the first variant (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10) and does not carry the missense variant." This suggests that the proband is compound heterozygous for two pathogenic variants.

INFERRED: The text continues to refer to "the subject" and "the proposita," suggesting that only one proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In conclusion, we broaden the clinical spectrum of WARS2 deficiency and report for the first time a severe hepatopathy associated with valproate treatment in a subject with WARS2 deficiency. Interestingly, the proband was initially considered as having a non-specific, non-progressive encephalopathy, and it was only when she developed hepatopathy after valproate treatment was started that the diagnosis of a mitochondrial defect was made."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Two variants were found in WARS2. One was a frameshift mutation (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10), the other a missense mutation (c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met). Both mutations are located in exon 6, the last exon of WARS2 (NM_015836) (Fig. 4). Twelve different pathogenic mutations in WARS2 have been reported so far. The identical compound heterozygous mutant genotype (p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ p.Lys313Met) was found in the two subjects with severe neonatal expression reported by Wortmann et al. (Table 2)." This confirms that the proband is compound heterozygous for two pathogenic variants in WARS2.
