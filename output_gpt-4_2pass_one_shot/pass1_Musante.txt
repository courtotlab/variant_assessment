## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The text mentions "two Iranian families affected by ARID" and "The probands were examined by experienced clinical geneticists who assessed their physical and mental status." This suggests that at least two probands were tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In the first family, homozygosity mapping in combination with subsequent mutation screening revealed a homozygous missense mutation in the Seryl-tRNA Synthetase (SARS) gene (MIM# 607529), which co-segregates with moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing." This suggests that there is at least one compound/double heterozygote in the second family.

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: No explicit quote found.

INFERRED: "Family 2 was part of a large study of the molecular basis of ARID and genotyping results of six DNA samples (IV:2, IV:3, V:2, V:7, V:8, V:9) from this family were used for homozygosity mapping and multipoint parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis." This suggests that at least six individuals were tested in Family 2, in addition to the two probands inferred from the previous text.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: No explicit quote found.

INFERRED: The table provides a list of clinical features for six individuals from two families. These features include delayed psychomotor development, ataxia, muscle weakness, seizures, behavior problems, speech impairment, and intellectual disability. It is inferred that these are the phenotypes associated with the probands being studied.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: No explicit quote found.

INFERRED: "Whole genome sequencing was performed in one affected (V:7) by Complete Genomics (Mountain View, CA) as previously described (Drmanac et al., 2010)." This suggests that at least one individual (V:7) from Family 2 underwent whole genome sequencing, which could potentially reveal compound/double heterozygous mutations. However, the exact number of compound/double heterozygotes is not explicitly stated.

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: No explicit quote found.

INFERRED: "Family 1 is an Iranian family with Arabian ethnicity. The distantly related parents had nine children, four of them presented with ID; the pedigree is shown in Figure 1A." This suggests that at least four probands were tested in Family 1.

INFERRED: "Family 2 is an Iranian family from the Semnan province of Iran. The consanguineous healthy parents had nine children, three of them with ID (Fig. 1B)." This suggests that at least three probands were tested in Family 2.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "All affected children were born at full term after uneventful pregnancies, followed by a normal neonatal period. Testing of cognitive function using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) showed an intelligence quotient (IQ) 40–45 in the range of moderate ID, speech impairment (slow and slurred speech) and aggressive behavior. In addition, the patients presented with microcephaly, ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years), and muscular weakness (since the age of 6–10). All patients developed tonic–clonic seizures during infancy, which are well controlled by sodium valproate."

EXPLICIT: "Two affected siblings (V:7 and V:8) presented with moderate ID (IQ = 41–46), athetosis, aggressive behavior, and speech impairment (slow and slurred speech). Moreover muscular weakness and ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years) were observed."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the WARS2 gene in the affected individuals of family 2 (Fig. 1B and D)." This confirms that there is at least one compound/double heterozygote in the second family.

INFERRED: "The WARS2 genotype we observed in the affected individuals comprises a frameshift mutation on the paternal allele and a missense change on the maternal allele." This suggests that the compound heterozygous genotype involves both a frameshift mutation and a missense change.

INFERRED: "In this report, we describe putatively ID causing mutations in SARS and WARS2 in families with closely overlapping additional clinical features including moderate ID, speech impairment, seizures, ataxia, and muscular weakness." This suggests that the probands being studied have these clinical features.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, whole genome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous genotype in affected individuals, consisting of a deleterious frame-shift mutation and a missense change (p.Trp13Gly) in the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase encoding WARS2." This confirms that there is at least one compound/double heterozygote in the second family.
