## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man"

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "This article presents the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a normal dose of mivacurium in a patient with phenotype SS"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man"

INFERRED: The text refers to "the patient" and "his family," suggesting that only one proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation." This suggests that there may be one heterozygous proband, but it is not clear if this individual is a proband of interest in this study.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "This article presents the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a normal dose of mivacurium in a patient with phenotype SS"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

INFERRED: "Thus, the patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations." This suggests that there is one compound heterozygote.
