1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we further increase the knowledge on the clinical presentation of WARS2 deficiency by presenting the first case with a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "At the age of 15 months, the patient had first come to medical attention because of ballistic movements and a stepwise loss of already acquired skills. Since the age of 2 years, the patient showed a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2 and a clinical phenotype consisting of a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits."

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we further increase the knowledge on the clinical presentation of WARS2 deficiency by presenting the first case with a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

INFERRED: The mention of "the first case" suggests that only one proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "At the age of 15 months, the patient had first come to medical attention because of ballistic movements and a stepwise loss of already acquired skills. Since the age of 2 years, the patient showed a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2 and a clinical phenotype consisting of a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits."

INFERRED: The mention of "a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2" suggests that there is one individual who is a compound or double heterozygote.
