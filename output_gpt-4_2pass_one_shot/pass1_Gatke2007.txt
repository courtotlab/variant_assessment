1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "As the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established with certainty using conventional biochemical tests, DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text mentions that "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126." This suggests that there was at least one heterozygous proband, although it's not explicitly stated that this proband was part of the study.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: No new explicit quotes found.

INFERRED: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126... The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M... The proband (2-1) was not sequenced, but had previously been ascribed a phenotype as compound heterozygous for the atypical variant and a silent variant using biochemical assays." This suggests that there were three probands tested in this study, consistent with the previously extracted quote.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3)." This explicitly states that there was one heterozygous proband.

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126 and displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine resulting in 3 hours of apnoea and hence postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit... The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M, the latter mutation also known as the H-variant. BChE activity was below detection limit, and the patient had experienced a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine of 90 min, which is six times the normal duration."

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M." This explicitly states that there was one compound heterozygous proband.

INFERRED: "The proband (2-1) was not sequenced, but had previously been ascribed a phenotype as compound heterozygous for the atypical variant and a silent variant using biochemical assays." This suggests that there may have been a second compound heterozygous proband, but it is not explicitly confirmed.
