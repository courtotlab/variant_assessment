## Pages 1-2 ##
EXPLICIT: "DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."
INFERRED: The mention of "two of the probands" suggests that more than one proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126." This suggests that at least one proband was not tested, but a relative was found to be heterozygous. It is not explicitly stated whether the probands tested were heterozygous.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine." 

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M." This explicitly states that one proband was compound heterozygous.
