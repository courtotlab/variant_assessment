## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."

INFERRED: The use of "the case" suggests a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp) who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."

INFERRED: Since the text refers to "compound heterozygous mutations" and no other individuals are mentioned in this context, it can be inferred that there is 1 compound heterozygote.

INFERRED: The patient's clinical description includes "infantile-onset Parkinsonism," "left leg tremor," "expressive language delay," "tremor in the upper extremities along with intermittent dystonic posturing of all extremities," "motor complications of more advanced PD including peak-dose and wearing-off phenomena with disabling retrocollic dystonic spasms," "Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism with prominent and unpredictable 'on-off' fluctuations, peak-dose dyskinesia, stooped posture and disabling off-dystonia," and "chronic headaches due to retrocollic dystonic spasms."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 and a clinical presentation of infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism."
