## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man..."
INFERRED: The use of "The patient" suggests a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozyous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."
INFERRED: Since the patient is described as compound heterozygous, this implies that there are no positive HET probands (i.e., heterozygous for a single pathogenic variant) reported in this study.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "This article presents the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a normal dose of mivacurium in a patient with phenotype SS..."
INFERRED: The phenotype associated with the proband is referred to as "phenotype SS," which is related to the response to mivacurium and extensively prolonged neuromuscular block.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."
INFERRED: Since the text refers to "The patient" as compound heterozygous, we can infer that there is 1 individual reported to have compound heterozygous mutations.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Retrospectively, the patient gave written informed consent to publish the results and permission to ask his family to participate in a pedigree analysis."
INFERRED: The use of "the patient" suggests a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of positive HET probands, but given that the patient and one brother are described as homozygous for silent mutations, and the parents and another brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation, it can be inferred that there are no positive HET probands reported in this study as part of the proband's immediate family.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The patient’s BChE activity was zero, indicating that he was homozygous for silent mutations."
INFERRED: The phenotype associated with the proband includes zero BChE activity due to homozygous silent mutations.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Thus, the patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations."
INFERRED: Since the text refers to "the patient" as compound heterozygous, we can infer that there is 1 individual reported to have compound heterozygous mutations.
