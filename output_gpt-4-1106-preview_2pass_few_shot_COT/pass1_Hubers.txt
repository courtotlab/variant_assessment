1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "Here, we further increase the knowledge on the clinical presentation of WARS2 deficiency by presenting the first case with a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism." This suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "Based on the suspected autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, we prioritized genes carrying biallelic variants in the index and detected 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_201263.2)." This indicates that the proband is not heterozygous but has biallelic variants, which implies that they are either homozygous or compound heterozygous.

INFERRED: There is no explicit mention of heterozygous probands, and the case presented involves biallelic variants, which are not consistent with a heterozygous state.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we further increase the knowledge on the clinical presentation of WARS2 deficiency by presenting the first case with a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

INFERRED: "All presented neurodevelopmental as well as complex movement disorders and variable other findings such as epilepsy or retinitis pigmentosa,4–6 classified as 'Neurodevelopmental disorder, mitochondrial, with abnormal movements and lactic acidosis, with or without seizures' (neurodevelopmental disorder (NEMMLAS), MIM #617710)."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

INFERRED: "Based on the suspected autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, we prioritized genes carrying biallelic variants in the index and detected 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_201263.2)." This suggests that the proband has two different variants in the WARS2 gene, which could be indicative of a compound heterozygous state. However, the text does not explicitly state "compound heterozygous," so this is inferred.

INFERRED: "The paternally inherited missense variant c.37T>G, p.(Trp13Gly) is listed as pathogenic in ClinVar (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/). The maternally inherited c.149G>A, p.Gly50Asp missense variant has not been previously described." This further supports the inference that the proband is compound heterozygous, having inherited one variant from each parent.
