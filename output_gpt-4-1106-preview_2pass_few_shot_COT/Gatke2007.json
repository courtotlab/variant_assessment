    "num_tested_probands": "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2-3).",
    "positive_phenotypes": "The probands displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine and mivacurium, with specific incidents of apnoea and postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit, and a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine of 90 min.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The proband in family 3 was explicitly described as compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M. The proband in family 1 had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, which suggests a compound heterozygous state."
