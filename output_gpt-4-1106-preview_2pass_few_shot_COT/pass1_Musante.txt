1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The patients and their families were recruited by the Genetics Research Center at the University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran, where genetic counselors obtained informed consent of the parents from both families in writing." This suggests that there were at least two families involved in the study, but the exact number of probands tested is not explicitly stated.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: "In the first family, we identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.514G>A, p.Asp172Asn) in the cytoplasmic seryl-tRNA synthetase (SARS) gene." This indicates that the proband in the first family is not heterozygous but homozygous.
INFERRED: "In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene, comprising a nonsense mutation (c.325delA, p.Ser109Alafs*15), which very likely entails nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and a missense mutation (c.37T>G, p.Trp13Gly)." This indicates that the proband in the second family is a compound heterozygote, not a simple heterozygote. Therefore, there are no positive HET probands explicitly mentioned.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "In the first family, homozygosity mapping in combination with subsequent mutation screening revealed a homozygous missense mutation in the Seryl-tRNA Synthetase (SARS) gene (MIM# 607529), which co-segregates with moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene, comprising a nonsense mutation (c.325delA, p.Ser109Alafs*15), which very likely entails nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and a missense mutation (c.37T>G, p.Trp13Gly)." This indicates that there is at least one compound heterozygote in the second family.
INFERRED: Since the text does not explicitly state the number of individuals with the compound heterozygous genotype in the second family, it is inferred that there is at least one based on the description provided.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "Family 1-III:4, Family 1-III:10, Family 1-III:9, Family 1-III:11, Family 2-V:7, Family 2-V:8" suggests that there are at least six individuals from two families who were tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."
INFERRED: The table lists clinical features such as "Delayed psychomotor development," "Ataxia," "Muscle weakness," "Seizure," "Behavior problems," "Speech impairment," "Intellectual disability," and "Other anomalies" like "Pes planus, thin body" and "Athetosis" for multiple individuals, which can be associated with the probands' phenotypes.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Family 2-V:7, Family 2-V:8" indicates that there are at least two individuals with compound heterozygous mutations.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of the patients (III:4, III:9, III:10, III:11), three healthy siblings and their parents, using standard procedures." This suggests that there were four probands tested in family 1.
INFERRED: "The consanguineous healthy parents had nine children, three of them with ID (Fig. 1B)." This suggests that there were at least two probands tested in family 2, as one affected male had died.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "All affected children were born at full term after uneventful pregnancies, followed by a normal neonatal period. Testing of cognitive function using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) showed an intelligence quotient (IQ) 40–45 in the range of moderate ID, speech impairment (slow and slurred speech) and aggressive behavior. In addition, the patients presented with microcephaly, ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years), and muscular weakness (since the age of 6–10). All patients developed tonic–clonic seizures during infancy, which are well controlled by sodium valproate."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: "Family 2 is an Iranian family from the Semnan province of Iran. The consanguineous healthy parents had nine children, three of them with ID (Fig. 1B)." Given the previous context that family 2 has a compound heterozygous genotype, it is inferred that there are at least two compound heterozygotes in family 2, as one affected male had died.

## Pages 9-10 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the WARS2 gene in the affected individuals of family 2 (Fig. 1B and D)." This suggests that there were affected individuals in family 2 who were tested, but the exact number is not explicitly stated.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The WARS2 genotype we observed in the affected individuals comprises a frameshift mutation on the paternal allele and a missense change on the maternal allele. The mutations cosegregated with the disease in the family." This suggests that the affected individuals with the WARS2 genotype have a disease phenotype that is associated with the identified mutations, although the specific phenotype is not described in this quote.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the WARS2 gene in the affected individuals of family 2 (Fig. 1B and D)." This indicates that there are affected individuals with a compound heterozygous genotype in family 2, but the exact number is not explicitly stated. However, based on the previously extracted quotes, it can be inferred that there are at least two such individuals.
INFERRED: "Family 2-V:7, Family 2-V:8" indicates that there are at least two individuals with compound heterozygous mutations.

## Pages 13-14 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "We are very grateful to the affected individuals and their family for their participation in the study." This suggests that there were multiple affected individuals, but the exact number of probands tested is not explicitly stated.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
INFERRED: "Functionally the mutations we found in SARS and WARS2 might lead to a reduced amount of charged tRNA available for translation at the ribosomes, which in turn could lead to a reduced translation rate, especially of those proteins that contain high amounts of serine, selenocysteine or tryptophan, respectively." This suggests that the probands may have phenotypes related to reduced translation rates of specific proteins, but no explicit phenotypes are mentioned in this quote.
