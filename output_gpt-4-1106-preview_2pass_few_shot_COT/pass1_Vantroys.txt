1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a 6-year-old girl in whom severe delay of early cognitive and motor development and mild dysmorphic facial features were initially suggestive of cerebral palsy or a chromosomal disorder as she was slightly dysmorphic."

INFERRED: The text suggests that the study focuses on a single proband, a 6-year-old girl.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)."

INFERRED: The proband was found to have two different pathogenic variants in the WARS2 gene, which suggests that she is a compound heterozygote rather than a positive HET proband with a single heterozygous mutation.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a 6-year-old girl in whom severe delay of early cognitive and motor development and mild dysmorphic facial features were initially suggestive of cerebral palsy or a chromosomal disorder as she was slightly dysmorphic."
EXPLICIT: "At the age of six years, she had an epileptic seizure which was treated with sodium valproate. In the months after treatment was started, she developed acute liver failure and severe progressive encephalopathy."
EXPLICIT: "The first subjects with deficiency of mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) were reported in 2017. Their clinical characteristics can be subdivided into three phenotypes (neonatal phenotype, severe infantile onset phenotype, Parkinson-like phenotype)."

INFERRED: The proband's phenotype includes early developmental delay, motor weakness, intellectual disability, epileptic seizure, acute liver failure, and severe progressive encephalopathy. These clinical features are consistent with the severe infantile onset phenotype of mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) deficiency.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)."

INFERRED: The proband is described as having two known pathogenic variants in WARS2, which implies that she is a compound heterozygote. Since only one proband is discussed, the number of compound/double heterozygotes is 1.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The same fractions were prepared from liver from the proband and controls."
INFERRED: The text continues to refer to "the proband" in singular, suggesting a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents."
EXPLICIT: "Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intra-uterine growth retardation."
EXPLICIT: "severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs were noticed and she was found to have slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum."
EXPLICIT: "severe delay of cognitive and motor development was confirmed."
EXPLICIT: "She had no head control and rigidity of arms and legs was noticed."
EXPLICIT: "Fists were bilaterally clenched."
EXPLICIT: "Deep tendon reflexes were weak and both feet were in equinus position."
EXPLICIT: "She was hospitalized because of a long lasting episode with decreased awareness, lateral eye deviation and twitching of the eyelids at the left."
EXPLICIT: "Dystonic posturing of the limbs together with motor hyperactivity and continuous choreatic movements were seen."
EXPLICIT: "She was diagnosed with acute liver failure (ALF) and metabolic encephalopathy."
EXPLICIT: "Ophthalmological examination revealed optic atrophy."
EXPLICIT: "Cerebral MRI showed enlargement of the lateral ventricles and third ventricle presumably due to white matter loss."
EXPLICIT: "Subarachnoidal spaces were abnormally large, most marked in the frontal regions bilaterally."
EXPLICIT: "In the posterior fossa, the vermis cerebelli was hypoplastic, the fourth ventricle was enlarged and the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles were hypoplastic."
EXPLICIT: "episodes with decreased awareness occurred more frequently."
EXPLICIT: "she was stuporous with ptosis of the eyelids bilaterally and severe generalized amyotrophy."
EXPLICIT: "No hepatomegaly neither signs of pyramidal tract involvement were found."
EXPLICIT: "Her neurological condition further deteriorated."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: The previous context indicates that the proband had two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene, suggesting that she is a compound heterozygote. Since only one proband is discussed, the number of compound/double heterozygotes is inferred to be 1.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a 6-year-old child with WARS2 deficiency. The proposita had presented at young age with developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability."
EXPLICIT: "Her condition remained stable for several years until she presented for the first time with seizures at the age of six years and a treatment with sodium valproate was initiated."
EXPLICIT: "During the next month, her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and ultimately she developed acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy."
EXPLICIT: "Sodium valproate was stopped but nevertheless she became progressively more unconscious and died half a year later."

INFERRED: The proband's phenotype includes early developmental delay, motor weakness, intellectual disability, epileptic seizure, acute liver failure, and severe progressive encephalopathy. These clinical features are consistent with the severe infantile onset phenotype of mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) deficiency.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)."

INFERRED: The proband is described as having two known pathogenic variants in WARS2, which implies that she is a compound heterozygote. Since only one proband is discussed, the number of compound/double heterozygotes is 1.
