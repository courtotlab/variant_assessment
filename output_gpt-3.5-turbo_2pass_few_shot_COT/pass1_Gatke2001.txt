1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man"
EXPLICIT: "Methods: The neuromuscular block following administration of mivacurium, at a dose of 0.14 mg/kg, was monitored in a 30-yr-old healthy man"
EXPLICIT: "A blood sample was drawn at the time of arrival in the intensive care unit to determine the BChE activity, phenotype, and genotype."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "Complete nucleotide sequencing revealed two point mutations, the known silent variant S7 and a previously undescribed mutation of amino acid residue 170 introducing a stop codon."
EXPLICIT: "Conclusions: The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "This article presents the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a normal dose of mivacurium in a patient with phenotype SS"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Conclusions: The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."
