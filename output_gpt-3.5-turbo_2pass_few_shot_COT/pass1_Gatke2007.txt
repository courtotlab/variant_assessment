## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "As the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established with certainty using conventional biochemical tests, DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "a member had experienced severely prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

EXPLICIT: "As the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established with certainty using conventional biochemical tests, DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3)."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "a member had experienced severely prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."
