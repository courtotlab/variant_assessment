1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "In 2017, 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2..."

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "All presented neurodevelopmental as well as complex movement disorders and variable other findings such as epilepsy or retinitis pigmentosa, classified as 'Neurodevelopmental disorder, mitochondrial, with abnormal movements and lactic acidosis, with or without seizures' (neurodevelopmental disorder (NEMMLAS), MIM #617710)."
EXPLICIT: "Here, we further increase the knowledge on the clinical presentation of WARS2 deficiency by presenting the first case with a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "In 2017, 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2..."
