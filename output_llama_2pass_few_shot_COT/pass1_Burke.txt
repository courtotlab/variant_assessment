Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The patient, following informed and written consent, under the protocol 76-HG-0238..."

INFERRED: The text mentions that clinical data and samples were obtained from the patient, but it does not explicitly state how many patients were tested.

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M..."

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient has compound heterozygous mutations, but it does not explicitly state how many individuals have this genotype.
