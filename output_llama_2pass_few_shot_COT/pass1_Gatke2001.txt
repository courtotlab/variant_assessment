This article presents a case report of a patient with a rare genetic mutation in the butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) gene who experiences an extensively prolonged duration of action to mivacurium, a neuromuscular blocking agent.

The patient, a 30-year-old man, was administered a normal dose of mivacurium (0.14 mg/kg) during anesthesia and experienced a prolonged neuromuscular block. The authors used a combination of clinical monitoring, pharmacokinetic analysis, and molecular genetic techniques to investigate the cause of this prolonged response.

The patient's blood samples were analyzed for BCHE activity, phenotype, and genotype, which revealed compound heterozygosity for two silent mutations in the BCHE gene. The authors used complete nucleotide sequencing to identify the specific mutations, which included a previously undescribed mutation at amino acid residue 170 that introduces a stop codon.

The study highlights the importance of molecular genetic techniques in identifying rare genetic mutations that can affect drug response. It also emphasizes the need for careful phenotyping and genotyping of patients with suspected abnormal responses to neuromuscular blocking agents.

Some key points from the article include:

* The patient's prolonged response to mivacurium was attributed to compound heterozygosity for two silent mutations in the BCHE gene.
* Complete nucleotide sequencing was used to identify the specific mutations, including a previously undescribed mutation at amino acid residue 170 that introduces a stop codon.
* The study highlights the importance of molecular genetic techniques in identifying rare genetic mutations that can affect drug response.
* The authors emphasize the need for careful phenotyping and genotyping of patients with suspected abnormal responses to neuromuscular blocking agents.

Overall, this article provides valuable insights into the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of mivacurium in a patient with a rare genetic mutation, highlighting the importance of molecular genetic techniques in understanding drug response.

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: The text mentions that "the authors used a combination of clinical monitoring, pharmacokinetic analysis, and molecular genetic techniques" but does not explicitly state the number of probands tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "The patient's blood samples were analyzed for BCHE activity, phenotype, and genotype, which revealed compound heterozygosity for two silent mutations in the BCHE gene."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state that the patient is a heterozygous carrier, but it implies that they are since their blood samples showed "compound heterozygosity" for two silent mutations.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The patient's phenotype was consistent with compound heterozygosity for two silent mutations."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the specific phenotypes associated with the patient, but it implies that they have a prolonged response to mivacurium and are consistent with compound heterozygosity.

4. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "This article presents a case report of a patient who experiences an extensively prolonged duration of action to mivacurium, a neuromuscular blocking agent."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of patients studied in this article, but it implies that there is only one case report.

Note that some of these answers are based on inference rather than explicit statements in the text.
