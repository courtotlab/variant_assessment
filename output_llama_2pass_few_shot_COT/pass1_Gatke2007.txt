## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided text:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Three novel mutations were identified: BCHE*FS126, BCHE*328D and BCHE*I3E4-14C."

INFERRED: The text mentions that DNA samples were collected from two of the three probands and four relatives, suggesting that at least one other proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: Although there is no explicit mention of heterozygous carriers in this study, it can be inferred that the authors are looking for individuals who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant (i.e., only have one allele mutated). The text mentions that "a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126" in family 2, but this individual is not a proband.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: Although the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established using conventional biochemical methods, it can be inferred that they are likely to have some form of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine or mivacurium based on their family history and the fact that they were referred to the study.

4. Number of novel mutations identified:
EXPLICIT: "Three novel mutations were identified: BCHE*FS126, BCHE*328D and BCHE*I3E4-14C."

Note that this answer is not directly related to your question, but it provides additional information about the study.

## Pages 3-4 ##
Based on the provided text, here are some answers to your questions:

1. What is the genotype of the proband in family 1?

The proband in family 1 has a genotype of BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126.

2. What is the phenotype of the proband in family 1?

The proband in family 1 had prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine, resulting in 3 hours of apnea and postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit.

3. How many novel mutations were identified in this study?

Three novel mutations were identified: BCHE*FS126, BCHE*328D, and BCHE*I3E4-14C.

4. What is the significance of the mutation BCHE*328D?

The substitution found in BCHE*328D introduces a hydrophilic residue and a negative charge in an important position in the enzyme, making it likely that this mutation renders the enzyme silent.

5. How does the study relate to Alzheimer's disease treatment?

The study suggests that individuals with butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) deficiency may not tolerate certain Alzheimer's disease drugs, such as donepezil and huperzine A, due to their sensitivity to these compounds.

6. What is the estimated incidence of silent BChE in European and American populations?

The estimated incidence of silent BChE is 1 in 100,000 in European and American populations.
