    "num_positive_het_probands": "Implicitly stated that the patient is a heterozygous carrier, but not explicitly confirmed.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "Explicitly stated in the text as 'The patient's phenotype was consistent with compound heterozygosity for two silent mutations'.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "Explicitly stated in the text as 'compound heterozygosity for two silent mutations' and also mentioned that there is one previously undescribed mutation at amino acid residue 170 that introduces a stop codon.",
    "explanation": "The study highlights the importance of molecular genetic techniques in identifying rare genetic mutations that can affect drug response. It also emphasizes the need for careful phenotyping and genotyping of patients with suspected abnormal responses to neuromuscular blocking agents."
