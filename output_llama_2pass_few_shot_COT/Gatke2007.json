    "num_positive_het_probands": "EXPLICIT: None. INFERRED: Although there is no explicit mention of heterozygous carriers in this study, it can be inferred that the authors are looking for individuals who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant (i.e., only have one allele mutated). The text mentions that 'a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126' in family 2, but this individual is not a proband.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "EXPLICIT: None. INFERRED: Although the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established using conventional biochemical methods, it can be inferred that they are likely to have some form of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine or mivacurium based on their family history and the fact that they were referred to the study.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "EXPLICIT: None. INFERRED: The text mentions that 'the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M' but does not provide information on other compound or double heterozygotes.",
    "explanation": "The study only explicitly mentions one compound heterozygote, the proband in family 3. However, it can be inferred that there may be others based on the mention of DNA samples being collected from relatives."
