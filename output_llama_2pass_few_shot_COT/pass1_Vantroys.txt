Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "One part was frozen for biochemical analysis and another part formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded."

INFERRED: The text mentions that liver tissue was obtained by laparoscopy, suggesting a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Severe delay of early cognitive and motor development and mild dysmorphic facial features were initially suggestive of cerebral palsy or a chromosomal disorder as she was slightly dysmorphic."

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient had "early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability", which could be related to a mitochondrial disorder.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Five PIGT variants were identified in two sporadic patients… case 16 carried 3 mutations… Seven different hemizygous PIGA mutations… among eight patients… Seven of the mutations were inherited from their mothers, and only one was de novo."

INFERRED: The text mentions that seven different hemizygous PIGA mutations were identified in eight patients, which could imply compound heterozygotes. However, it is not explicitly stated that these individuals are compound heterozygotes.

Note: There is no explicit mention of the number of compound/double heterozygotes in the text. The information provided is about the presence of multiple variants and mutations in different genes, but it does not provide a clear count of compound/heterozygous cases.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

No explicit information is provided in the text about the number of compound/heterozygous cases. However, it is mentioned that two compound heterozygous variants were identified in the WARS2 gene, and both variants are rare in the healthy population.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity... As the position of the missense variant was not affected by the deletion, both variants were located on a different allele."
INFERRED: The text mentions that two compound heterozygous variants were identified in the WARS2 gene, and both variants are rare in the healthy population.

Note: There is no explicit mention of the number of compound/double heterozygotes in the text. However, it is mentioned that a third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity, which implies that there may be multiple compound/heterozygous cases.

Additionally, based on the provided text, here are some other answers:

5. What is the clinical spectrum of WARS2 deficiency?
EXPLICIT: "We broaden the clinical spectrum of WARS2 deficiency and report for the first time a severe hepatopathy associated with valproate treatment in a subject with WARS2 deficiency."

6. What is the most frequently detected pathogenic mutation in WARS2?
EXPLICIT: "The p.Lys313Met missense mutation is the most frequently detected pathogenic mutation in WARS2, at least in the European population, as it was detected in five of the eleven reported subjects (including the one reported here)."

7. What is the association between WARS2 deficiency and valproate-induced hepatopathy?
EXPLICIT: "Apparently, pathogenic mutations in the nuclear genes POLG, TWNK and WARS2, and in the mitochondrial genes tRNALeu and tRNALys, all affecting intramitochondrial transcription and/or translation, have been associated with valproate-induced acute liver failure."

8. What is the significance of the mosaic pattern after activity staining of cytochrome c oxidase in the liver?
EXPLICIT: "Hepatocytes with strong mitochondrial activity were found adjacent to cells that showed scarce or no reaction product (Fig. 1c-d). Mito-chondrial mosaic staining for cytochrome c oxidase in liver has previously been reported in six subjects..."

9. What is the implication of the presence of a subcomplex of complex V in the liver?
EXPLICIT: "The presence of a subcomplex of complex V was therefore suggestive of an intramitochondrial protein synthesis defect."

10. What is the conclusion of the study?
EXPLICIT: "In conclusion, we broaden the clinical spectrum of WARS2 deficiency and report for the first time a severe hepatopathy associated with valproate treatment in a subject with WARS2 deficiency."

I can help you summarize the text.

The text appears to be a research article discussing the clinical spectrum of WARS2 deficiency, a rare genetic disorder affecting mitochondrial protein synthesis. The authors report on 11 patients with WARS2 deficiency, including one case with severe hepatopathy associated with valproate treatment.

Here are some key points from the text:

1. **Clinical spectrum**: The authors broaden the clinical spectrum of WARS2 deficiency, which includes early developmental delay, motor weakness, intellectual disability, and mild dysmorphic facial features.
2. **Pathogenic mutations**: The most frequently detected pathogenic mutation in WARS2 is the p.Lys313Met missense mutation.
3. **Association with valproate-induced hepatopathy**: Pathogenic mutations in nuclear genes (POLG, TWNK) and mitochondrial genes (tRNALeu, tRNALys) are associated with valproate-induced acute liver failure.
4. **Mosaic pattern after activity staining of cytochrome c oxidase**: Hepatocytes with strong mitochondrial activity were found adjacent to cells that showed scarce or no reaction product, suggesting an intramitochondrial protein synthesis defect.
5. **Subcomplex of complex V in the liver**: The presence of a subcomplex of complex V was suggestive of an intramitochondrial protein synthesis defect.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering WARS2 deficiency as a potential cause of valproate-induced hepatopathy and provides new insights into the clinical spectrum of this rare genetic disorder.
