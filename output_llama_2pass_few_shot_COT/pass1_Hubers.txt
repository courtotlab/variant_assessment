## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "19 different mitochondrial tRNA synthetases exist and are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis."

INFERRED: The text mentions that 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, but it does not explicitly state the number of probands tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements."

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient had a "severe hyperkinetic movement disorder" and that he showed "cognitive deficits".

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "2 variants in WARS2 (c.37T>G, p.(Trp13Gly) and c.149G>A, p.Gly50Asp missense variant)"

Note that the text does not explicitly state whether these variants are compound or double heterozygous, but based on the context, it appears to be a case of compound heterozygosity.

INFERRED: The text mentions that 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, but it does not explicitly state the number of probands tested.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient had a "severe hyperkinetic movement disorder" and that he showed "cognitive deficits".

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "2 variants in WARS2 (c.37T>G, p.(Trp13Gly) and c.149G>A, p.Gly50Asp missense variant)"
INFERRED: The text notes that the patient had a case of compound heterozygosity for two different pathogenic variants in WARS2.

Note that there is no explicit mention of the total number of probands tested or the exact classification of the compound/double heterozygotes (e.g., whether it's a single individual with both variants or multiple individuals with each variant).
