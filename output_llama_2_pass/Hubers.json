INFERRED: The text mentions that 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, but it does not explicitly state the number of probands tested. However, since the question asks for the number of individual probands for whom genetic testing was reported only in this study (not in other studies), we can infer that there is at least one proband tested.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "INFERRED: The text mentions that 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, but it does not provide information on the number of heterozygous (HET) cases among them. However, since the question asks for the number of probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, we can infer that there are at least 9 HET probands.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "EXPLICIT: None. INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient had a clinical presentation consisting of a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder, cognitive deficits, and other symptoms such as epilepsy or retinitis pigmentosa. However, it does not explicitly state all the positive proband phenotypes.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "INFERRED: The text mentions that no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected in the mitochondrial DNA, but it does not provide information on the number of individuals reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations. However, since the question asks for the number of individuals with this condition, we can infer that there is at least one individual (the patient) who is a compound/double heterozygote."
