However, it mentions that 'Clinical data and patient samples were obtained in accordance with the ethical standards approved by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Institutional Review Board (IRB)', which implies that the study involved a certain number of patients, but the exact number is not specified.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "The text does not provide explicit information on the number of individuals who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant. However, it mentions that 'The patient was compound heterozygous for 2 variants in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp)', which suggests that there was at least one individual with this specific genotype.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "The text mentions that 'The patient presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years', which implies that the patient had a specific clinical phenotype. Additionally, the text mentions that 'the patient's condition was characterized by decreased steady-state WARS2 protein and normal OXPHOS content', which suggests that the patient had a specific biochemical abnormality.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The text mentions that 'The patient was compound heterozygous for 2 variants in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp)', which suggests that there was at least one individual with this specific genotype. However, it does not provide information on the total number of individuals who were compound or double heterozygotes."
