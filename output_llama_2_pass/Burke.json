    "num_tested_probands": "The text does not explicitly state the number of probands tested. However, it mentions that 'Clinical data and patient samples were obtained in accordance with the ethical standards approved by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Institutional Review Board (IRB)'. This suggests that only one patient was studied.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "The text does not provide explicit information on the number of heterozygous probands. However, it mentions that 'Analysis of patient-derived dermal fibroblasts revealed decreased steady-state WARS2 protein and normal OXPHOS content.' This suggests that the patient has a compound heterozygous mutation in WARS2.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "The text does not provide explicit information on the specific phenotypes of the proband. However, it mentions that 'Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism presenting in infancy or childhood is extraordinarily rare and may occur as a comorbidity to other diseases or genetic conditions.' This suggests that the patient's phenotype is consistent with this rare condition.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The text explicitly states that the patient has compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2."
