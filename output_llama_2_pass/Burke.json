    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "There is no explicit mention of other individuals with compound or double heterozygous mutations, but the authors do mention that they analyzed the family and used molecular genetic methods to identify the genotype. This patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene.",
    "explanation": "The text does not provide a clear answer to question 1, as it does not explicitly state the number of individuals tested. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that at least one individual (the patient) was tested, and possibly others in the family."
