    "num_positive_het_probands": "The text does not provide explicit information on the number of heterozygous probands. However, it mentions that 'siblings and parents were also sequenced' to confirm co-segregation of the allele within families, suggesting that multiple individuals may have been tested.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "The text describes the phenotypes observed in both families, including moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior. These phenotypes are associated with mutations in SARS and WARS2 genes.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The text mentions that the second family had a 'compound DNA-alteration' affecting the WARS2 gene, suggesting that at least one individual may have been a compound or double heterozygote."
