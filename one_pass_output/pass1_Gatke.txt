## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "This patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) scheduled for correction of the inner nose."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of individuals tested, but it mentions that the authors analyzed the patient's family and used molecular genetic methods to identify the genotype.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: There is no explicit mention of heterozygous (HET) cases in the text. However, the authors do mention that the patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations, which implies that at least one other individual may have been tested.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The patient had a phenotype SS."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on the phenotypes of other individuals in the study.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "This patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

INFERRED: There is no explicit mention of other individuals with compound or double heterozygous mutations, but the authors do mention that they analyzed the family and used molecular genetic methods to identify the genotype.

INFERRED: There is no explicit mention of other individuals with compound or double heterozygous mutations, but the authors do mention that they analyzed the family and used molecular genetic methods to identify the genotype.

Note: The text does not provide a clear answer to question 1, as it does not explicitly state the number of individuals tested. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that at least one individual (the patient) was tested, and possibly others in the family.

## Pages 5-6 ##
The text discusses the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mivacurium in a patient with a rare genetic mutation affecting butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity. Here are some key points:

1. The patient had a phenotype SS, indicating low BChE activity, and was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the BChE gene.
2. Mivacurium is metabolized by BChE, and patients with low BChE activity have prolonged neuromuscular blockade.
3. The authors analyzed the patient's family using molecular genetic methods to identify the genotype.
4. The study found that the patient had a prolonged duration of action (274 minutes) compared to normal patients or those with decreased BChE activity due to organ failure.
5. The pharmacokinetic results were affected by the fact that venous sampling was not started until 134 minutes after mivacurium administration, which may have impacted the accuracy of the results.
6. The authors suggest that identification of the rare silent mutations is crucial for understanding the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of mivacurium in patients with low BChE activity.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of genetic testing in understanding the variability in response to mivacurium among patients with low BChE activity.

Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided text:

1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of individuals tested, but it mentions that the authors analyzed the patient's family and used molecular genetic methods to identify the genotype.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: There is no explicit mention of heterozygous (HET) cases in the text. However, the authors do mention that the patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations, which implies that at least one other individual may have been tested.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The patient had a phenotype SS."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on the phenotypes of other individuals in the study.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "This patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."
INFERRED: There is no explicit mention of other individuals with compound or double heterozygous mutations, but the authors do mention that they analyzed the family and used molecular genetic methods to identify the genotype.

Note: The text does not provide a clear answer to question 1, as it does not explicitly state the number of individuals tested. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that at least one individual (the patient) was tested, and possibly others in the family.

Also, there is no explicit mention of heterozygous (HET) cases in the text, so question 2 cannot be answered with certainty.
