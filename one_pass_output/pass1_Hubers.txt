## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "19 different mitochondrial tRNA synthetases exist and are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis."

INFERRED: The text mentions that 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, but it does not explicitly state the number of probands tested. However, since the question asks for the number of individual probands for whom genetic testing was reported only in this study (not in other studies), we can infer that there is at least one proband tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, but it does not provide information on the number of heterozygous (HET) cases among them. However, since the question asks for the number of probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, we can infer that there are at least 9 HET probands.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements."

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient had a clinical presentation consisting of a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder, cognitive deficits, and other symptoms such as epilepsy or retinitis pigmentosa. However, it does not explicitly state all the positive proband phenotypes.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected in the mitochondrial DNA, but it does not provide information on the number of individuals reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations. However, since the question asks for the number of individuals with this condition, we can infer that there is at least one individual (the patient) who is a compound/double heterozygote.

Note: The text does not provide explicit information on the number of probands tested, positive HET probands, or compound/double heterozygotes. However, based on the context and inference, we can make educated guesses about these values.
