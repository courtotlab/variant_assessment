## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: The text mentions that "the subject reported here was first diagnosed as having cerebral palsy" and that "it was only after sodium valproate was initiated that acute liver failure was diagnosed". This suggests that there is only one individual being studied.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "severe delay of early cognitive and motor development" (referring to the patient's condition)

EXPLICIT: "mild dys-morphic facial features"

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient was initially diagnosed with cerebral palsy, but later developed acute liver failure after starting sodium valproate treatment. This suggests that the patient had a progressive neurological disorder.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "compound heterozygous" (referring to the patient's genetic mutation)

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient was diagnosed with mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase deficiency, which is caused by mutations in the WARS2 gene. It also mentions that the patient had a mosaic pattern of cytochrome c oxidase staining in hepatocytes, suggesting heterogeneity in the mutation.

It also mentions that the patient had a mosaic pattern of cytochrome c oxidase staining in hepatocytes, suggesting heterogeneity in the mutation.

Note: There is no explicit mention of the number of compound/double heterozygotes in the text. The only mention of heterozygosity is in relation to the WARS2 gene mutations, but it does not specify whether these are compound or double heterozygous variants.

## Pages 5-6 ##
Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "the subject reported here was first diagnosed as having cerebral palsy" and "it was only after sodium valproate was initiated that acute liver failure was diagnosed". This suggests that there is only one individual being studied.

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient's condition remained stable for several years until she presented for the first time with seizures, which further supports the inference that there is only one proband tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "severe delay of early cognitive and motor development" (referring to the patient's condition)
EXPLICIT: "mild dys-morphic facial features"

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient was initially diagnosed with cerebral palsy, but later developed acute liver failure after starting sodium valproate treatment. This suggests that the patient had a progressive neurological disorder.

Note: There is no explicit mention of the number of compound/double heterozygotes in the text. The only mention of heterozygosity is in relation to the WARS2 gene mutations, but it does not specify whether these are compound or double heterozygous variants.

Uncertainty/Ambiguity:
The text does not provide explicit information on the number of probands tested, positive HET probands, or compound/double heterozygotes. The inferences made above are based on contextual clues and may be subject to interpretation.

## Pages 7-8 ##
Here is the revised response:

1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: The text mentions that "the subject reported here was first diagnosed as having cerebral palsy" and that "it was only after sodium valproate was initiated that acute liver failure was diagnosed". This suggests that there is only one individual being studied.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "severe delay of early cognitive and motor development" (referring to the patient's condition)
EXPLICIT: "mild dys-morphic facial features"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "compound heterozygous" (referring to the patient's genetic mutation)

Uncertainty/Ambiguity:
The text does not provide explicit information on the number of probands tested, positive HET probands, or compound/double heterozygotes. The inferences made above are based on contextual clues and may be subject to interpretation.

Note: There is no mention of the WARS2 gene mutations being compound or double heterozygous variants in the text.
