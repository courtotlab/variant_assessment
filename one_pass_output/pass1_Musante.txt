Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The probands were examined by experienced clinical geneticists who assessed their physical and mental status."

INFERRED: The text mentions that the study was conducted on two Iranian families, suggesting that there may be multiple individuals in each family being studied.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No explicit quotes or information is found to directly answer this question. However, INFERRED: The text mentions that the first family had a homozygous missense mutation in the SARS gene, which suggests that there may be only one individual with this mutation (i.e., the proband).

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior"

EXPLICIT: "ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior" (from the second family)

INFERRED: The text mentions that the probands in both families had similar accompanying features, such as moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene"

INFERRED: The text mentions that the second family had a compound heterozygous genotype in the WARS2 gene, suggesting that there may be only one individual with this mutation (i.e., the proband).

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No explicit quotes or information is found to directly answer this question. However, INFERRED: The text does not provide enough information to determine the number of heterozygous probands. It only mentions that one affected member (V:7) was sequenced and that siblings and parents were also sequenced, but it does not specify how many individuals in each family are being studied.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior"

EXPLICIT: "ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior" (from the second family)

I can help you summarize the results of the study. However, I don't see any explicit quotes or information about the results in the provided text.

Based on the context and the structure of the text, it appears that the study was conducted on two Iranian families with consanguineous parents who had children with intellectual disability (ID). The study aimed to identify genetic mutations associated with ID in these families.

The text mentions that DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of patients, healthy siblings, and their parents. Clinical descriptions of the patients are summarized in Table 1.

Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to provide a detailed summary of the results. If you could provide more context or clarify what specific information you would like me to extract, I'll do my best to help.

Additionally, here are some answers to other questions:

5. What is the name of the protein encoded by the WARS2 gene? The WARS2 gene encodes a mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase.

6. What is the function of the WARS2 protein? The WARS2 protein plays a crucial role in the synthesis of tryptophan-containing tRNAs, which are essential for protein synthesis and cell growth.

7. What is the significance of the p.Trp13Gly mutation in the WARS2 gene? The p.Trp13Gly mutation affects the mitochondrial localization of the WARS2 protein, leading to impaired function and potentially contributing to the development of intellectual disability.
