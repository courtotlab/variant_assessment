## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
- EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine at a time, when it was not possible to perform genotyping."

2. Number of positive HET probands:
- INFERRED: The text mentions that one patient in family 3 was "heterozygous for BCHE*142M", but does not explicitly state the number of heterozygous probands.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
- EXPLICIT: "SS" (homozygous for silent variants) is mentioned as a phenotype for patients in family 1 and 3.
- INFERRED: The text also mentions that patient 2 was "heterozygous for BCHE*FS126", but does not explicitly state the phenotype.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
- EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126."

Note that there is some ambiguity and uncertainty in the text, particularly with regards to the number of positive HET probands and compound/double heterozygotes.

- EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine at a time, when it was not possible to perform genotyping."
- INFERRED: The text mentions that one patient in family 3 was "heterozygous for BCHE*142M", but does not explicitly state the number of heterozygous probands.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
- EXPLICIT: "SS" (homozygous for silent variants) is mentioned as a phenotype for patients in family 1 and 3.
- INFERRED: The text also mentions that patient 2 was "heterozygous for BCHE*FS126", but does not explicitly state the phenotype.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
- EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126."
- INFERRED: The text also mentions that patient 3 was "compound heterozygous" for the mutations BCHE*142M and BCHE*FS126.

Note that there is some ambiguity and uncertainty in the text, particularly with regards to the number of positive HET probands.
