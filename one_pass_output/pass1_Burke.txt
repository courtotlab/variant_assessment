Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The patient, following informed and written consent, under the protocol 76-HG-0238, “Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism or Other Genetic Disorders” of the NIH-UDP."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of probands tested. However, it mentions that "Clinical data and patient samples were obtained in accordance with the ethical standards approved by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Institutional Review Board (IRB)". This suggests that only one patient was studied.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the number of heterozygous probands. However, it mentions that "Analysis of patient-derived dermal fibroblasts revealed decreased steady-state WARS2 protein and normal OXPHOS content." This suggests that the patient has a compound heterozygous mutation in WARS2, but it does not provide information on the number of other heterozygous probands.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism"

INFERRED: The text mentions that "Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism presenting in infancy or childhood is extraordinarily rare and may occur as a comorbidity to other diseases or genetic conditions." This suggests that the patient's phenotype is consistent with this rare condition.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The patient, following informed and written consent, under the protocol 76-HG-0238, “Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism or Other Genetic Disorders” of the NIH-UDP."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state that the patient is a compound heterozygote. However, it mentions that "Analysis of patient-derived dermal fibroblasts revealed decreased steady-state WARS2 protein and normal OXPHOS content." This suggests that the patient has a compound heterozygous mutation in WARS2.

Note: The text does not provide information on the number of other individuals who are compound or double heterozygotes.

Here is the revised response:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The patient, following informed and written consent, under the protocol 76-HG-0238, “Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism or Other Genetic Disorders” of the NIH-UDP."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of probands tested. However, it mentions that "Clinical data and patient samples were obtained in accordance with the ethical standards approved by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Institutional Review Board (IRB)". This suggests that only one patient was studied.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the number of heterozygous probands. However, it mentions that "Analysis of patient-derived dermal fibroblasts revealed decreased steady-state WARS2 protein and normal OXPHOS content." This suggests that the patient has a compound heterozygous mutation in WARS2.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the specific phenotypes of the proband. However, it mentions that "Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism presenting in infancy or childhood is extraordinarily rare and may occur as a comorbidity to other diseases or genetic conditions." This suggests that the patient's phenotype is consistent with this rare condition.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state that the patient is a compound heterozygote. However, it mentions that "Analysis of patient-derived dermal fibroblasts revealed decreased steady-state WARS2 protein and normal OXPHOS content." This suggests that the patient has a compound heterozygous mutation in WARS2.

Note: The text does not provide information on the number of other individuals who are compound or double heterozygotes.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."

INFERRED: The text explicitly states that the patient has compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2.
