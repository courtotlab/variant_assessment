1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on mutations in two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that are associated with ID in two unrelated Iranian families."

INFERRED: The mention of "two unrelated Iranian families" suggests that there are two probands, one from each family.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not explicitly mention any probands who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In the first family, homozygosity mapping in combination with subsequent mutation screening revealed a homozygous missense mutation in the Seryl-tRNA Synthetase (SARS) gene (MIM# 607529), which co-segregates with moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene, comprising a nonsense mutation (c.325delA, p.Ser109Alafs*15), which very likely entails nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and a missense mutation (c.37T>G, p.Trp13Gly)." 

INFERRED: The description of "compound heterozygous genotype" in the second family suggests there is 1 compound heterozygote.

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Family 1 is an Iranian family with Arabian ethnicity. The distantly related parents had nine children, four of them presented with ID; the pedigree is shown in Figure 1A."

INFERRED: The mention of "two unrelated Iranian families" and the detailed description of affected children in each family suggest that there are two probands, one from each family.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not explicitly mention any probands who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "All affected children were born at full term after uneventful pregnancies, followed by a normal neonatal period. Testing of cognitive function using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) showed an intelligence quotient (IQ) 40–45 in the range of moderate ID, speech impairment (slow and slurred speech) and aggressive behavior. In addition, the patients presented with microcephaly, ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years), and muscular weakness (since the age of 6–10). All patients developed tonic–clonic seizures during infancy, which are well controlled by sodium valproate."

EXPLICIT: "Two affected siblings (V:7 and V:8) presented with moderate ID (IQ = 41–46), athetosis, aggressive behavior, and speech impairment (slow and slurred speech). Moreover muscular weakness and ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years) were observed."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
