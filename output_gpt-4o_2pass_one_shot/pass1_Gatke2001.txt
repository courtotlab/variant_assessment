1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man..." suggests a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not mention any probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) scheduled for correction of the inner nose."

INFERRED: "The response to mivacurium was an extensively prolonged duration of action." This suggests a phenotype related to prolonged neuromuscular block.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene." This indicates there is one compound heterozygote.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "Retrospectively, the patient gave written informed consent to publish the results and permission to ask his family to participate in a pedigree analysis." This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The patient’s BChE activity was zero, indicating that he was homozygous for silent mutations."

INFERRED: "The case presented shows that patients compound heterozygous for two silent mutations respond to mivacurium with extensively prolonged duration of action." This suggests a phenotype related to prolonged neuromuscular block.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Thus, the patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations." This indicates there is one compound heterozygote.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation." This indicates there are heterozygous individuals, but they are not the proband.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) scheduled for correction of the inner nose."

INFERRED: "The response to mivacurium was an extensively prolonged duration of action." and "The patient’s BChE activity was zero, indicating that he was homozygous for silent mutations." These suggest a phenotype related to prolonged neuromuscular block.
