The response to mivacurium was an extensively prolonged duration of action. The patient\u2019s BChE activity was zero, indicating that he was homozygous for silent mutations.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene. This indicates there is one compound heterozygote."
