## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability..."

INFERRED: The consistent use of singular terms such as "a subject," "the subject," and "the proband" throughout the text suggests that only one proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text mentions "two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)," which implies compound heterozygosity rather than simple heterozygosity. Therefore, there are no positive HET probands explicitly mentioned.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability"

EXPLICIT: "severe progressive encephalopathy"

EXPLICIT: "acute liver failure"

INFERRED: "mild dysmorphic facial features" and "slightly dysmorphic" suggest additional phenotypic features.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)" indicates compound heterozygosity.

INFERRED: The description of the genetic findings in the singular proband suggests there is one compound heterozygote.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The consistent use of singular terms such as "the proband" and detailed description of a single case throughout the text suggests that only one proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text describes "two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene," indicating compound heterozygosity rather than simple heterozygosity. Therefore, there are no positive HET probands explicitly mentioned.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents. Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intrauterine growth retardation."

EXPLICIT: "severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs"

EXPLICIT: "slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum."

EXPLICIT: "severe delay of cognitive and motor development"

EXPLICIT: "acute liver failure (ALF) and metabolic encephalopathy."

INFERRED: The detailed clinical course, including episodes of decreased awareness, optic atrophy, and severe generalized amyotrophy, suggests a complex phenotype involving neurological and metabolic components.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836)."

INFERRED: The description of the genetic findings in the singular proband suggests there is one compound heterozygote.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The consistent use of singular terms such as "the proband" and detailed description of a single case throughout the text suggests that only one proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not explicitly mention any probands who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant without being compound heterozygous.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability"

EXPLICIT: "seizures"

EXPLICIT: "acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy"

INFERRED: The mention of "extra-pyramidal signs" and "epilepsy" in the context of the proband's phenotype suggests additional neurological features.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity."

INFERRED: The description of the genetic findings in the singular proband suggests there is one compound heterozygote.

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The consistent use of singular terms such as "the subject," "the proband," and detailed description of a single case throughout the text suggests that only one proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not explicitly mention any probands who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant without being compound heterozygous.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "epilepsy, ptosis, hypoglycaemia, valproate induced hepatotoxicity"

INFERRED: The mention of "a severe hepatopathy associated with valproate treatment" and "a non-specific, non-progressive encephalopathy" suggests additional phenotypic features related to liver and neurological issues.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The identical compound heterozygous mutant genotype (p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ p.Lys313Met) was found in the two subjects with severe neonatal expression reported by Wortmann et al."

INFERRED: The description of the genetic findings in the singular proband suggests there is one compound heterozygote.
