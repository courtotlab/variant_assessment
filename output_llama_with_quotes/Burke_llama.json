      "Mitochondrial DNA content by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis was 76% of age- and tissue-matched control.",
      "Numerous publications have documented significant phenotypic variability caused by defects in mtARS genes.6,7 Patients harboring biallelic mutation in AARS2, for example, may present with intrauterine or perinatal cardiomyopathy,20 adolescent onset ovario leukodystrophy21 or late-onset neurodegeneration in patients with hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS).22",
      "The latest mtARS to be linked to a disease is WARS2, based upon 2 independent case reports. Musante et al9 described 2 sib-lings with moderate delayed psychomotor development, speech impairment, ataxia, and athetoid movements.",
      "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 and a clinical presentation of infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism. While the clinical presentations vary substantially among the reported WARS2 cases and our own patient, there are some shared similarities.",
      "The first family carried one of the alleles found in our patient (p.Trp13Gly), along with a frameshift mutation predicted to result in loss of function; the latter may account for the more severe intellectual disability seen in the affected siblings.",
      "MRI information was not provided to establish the presence or absence of leukoencephalopathy. The MRI of the patient reported by Theisen et al revealed a periventricular multifocal leu-koencephalopathy, but the clinical presentation might have been compounded by perinatal insult.",
      "Both previous reports indicate intellectual disability, various neurological deficits, and symptoms including motor control disorders (ataxia, tremor, spasticity and athetoid movement).",
      "Theisen et al8 found impaired RC subunit expression in their patient with WARS2 mutations, while we found no significant change in RC subunit expression or function in our patient\u2019s muscle tissue.",
      "This difference likely reflects the unique impact that a specific variant in WARS2 can have on the resulting cellular and clinical phenotype, or different methodologies.",
      "In general, it is not uncommon for mtARS defects to have no effect on RC subunit expression in patient fibroblasts.23 Interestingly, the mtDNA content of the muscle is still lower than age-matched control; this, together with the finding of increased mitochondrial CoQ10 content may suggest some compensation for the mtDNA depletion.",
      "WES and whole genome SNP array data analysis for known variants and copy number variations associated with PD did not yield significant findings. The association of the patient\u2019s WARS2 variants to Parkinsonism or PD may be further clarified by systematically interrogating available cohorts for such mutations.",
      "MRI imaging at the time of our evaluation revealed a structurally normal study without evidence of abnormal mineral or metal deposition in the deep brain nuclei or leukoencephalopathy, but rather minimal non-specific atrophy.",
      "The temporal pattern of our patient\u2019s clinical progression has followed the prototypical course of adult idiopathic PD, except that it began 6 decades earlier. Specifically, our patient exhibited the typical early \u2018honeymoon\u2019 response to Levodopa supplementation allowing for several years of excellent clinical response, followed by increasingly severe motor fluctuation associated with progressive nigrostriatal denervation that eventually led to the need for DBS at age 10 to achieve control of motor complications.",
      "In conclusion, we expand the phenotypic spectrum of disorders caused by biallelic mutations in WARS2 gene to include infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism and implicate WARS2 dysfunction as a potential driver of mitochondrial dysfunction leading to nigrostriatal degeneration and Parkinsonism."
