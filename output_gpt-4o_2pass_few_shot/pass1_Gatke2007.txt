## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "We report the identification of two novel mutations in BCHE identified in three families, a member of which has experienced severely prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

INFERRED: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "one was heterozygous for the atypical and a silent variant (AS)."

INFERRED: "2–1 257 28 AS Not sequenced 2.0 360" (indicating heterozygous for the atypical and a silent variant)

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine"

INFERRED: "In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126" (suggesting compound heterozygosity)
