EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)." 

INFERRED: "The presence of two pathogenic variants suggests compound heterozygosity."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents." (This suggests a single proband.)

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents. Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intrauterine growth retardation."

EXPLICIT: "severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs"

EXPLICIT: "slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum."

EXPLICIT: "severe delay of cognitive and motor development"

EXPLICIT: "optic atrophy"

EXPLICIT: "acute liver failure (ALF) and metabolic encephalopathy."

INFERRED: "episodes with decreased awareness, lateral eye deviation and twitching of the eyelids" (suggestive of seizure activity)

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836)." 

INFERRED: "The presence of two pathogenic variants suggests compound heterozygosity."

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "Here, we report on a 6-year-old child with WARS2 deficiency." (This suggests a single proband.)

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability."

EXPLICIT: "seizures at the age of six years."

EXPLICIT: "acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy."

INFERRED: "protracted course, early onset developmental delay, motor weakness, extra-pyramidal signs, epilepsy." (The phenotype of the subject reported here fits into this category.)

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity."

INFERRED: "The presence of two pathogenic variants suggests compound heterozygosity."

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "The presence of a subcomplex of complex V in our subject was therefore suggestive of an intramitochondrial protein synthesis defect." (This suggests a single proband.)

INFERRED: "In the subject reported here, microscopic examination of liver showed a mosaic pattern after activity staining of cytochrome c oxidase." (This suggests a single proband.)

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "epilepsy, ptosis, hypoglycaemia, valproate induced hepatotoxicity"

INFERRED: "A defect in a nuclear encoded gene was suspected in the proposita as a combined defect of OXPHOS complexes involving the complexes I, III and IV was seen in liver, together with the presence of a subcomplex of complex V and the normal entire mtDNA sequencing." (Suggestive of mitochondrial disorder phenotype)

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The identical compound heterozygous mutant genotype (p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ p.Lys313Met) was found in the two subjects with severe neonatal expression reported by Wortmann et al."

INFERRED: "The presence of two pathogenic variants suggests compound heterozygosity."
