1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp)..."

INFERRED: "The patient, following informed and written consent, under the protocol 76-HG-0238, 'Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism or Other Genetic Disorders' of the NIH-UDP." (This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.)

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. (The text describes a compound heterozygous mutation, not a simple heterozygous mutation.)

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years."

INFERRED: "This case expands the phenotypic spectrum of WARS2 deficiency and emphasizes the importance of mitochondrial protein synthesis in the pathogenesis of Parkinsonism."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp)..." 

INFERRED: "The patient, following informed and written consent, under the protocol 76-HG-0238..." (This suggests a single compound heterozygous individual was reported in this study.)

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was the first and only child born to non-consanguineous parents of European descent with no relevant family history."

INFERRED: "The patient, following informed and written consent, was admitted in the NIH Clinical Center under the protocol 76-HG-0238..." (This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.)

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. (The text describes a compound heterozygous mutation, not a simple heterozygous mutation.)

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Early development was normal until the age of 1 when he was first noted to have left leg tremor while learning to stand."

EXPLICIT: "At 18 months, the left leg tremor spread to his right leg and he was noted to have expressive language delay despite good receptive language skills."

EXPLICIT: "By 23 months, tremor had also become apparent in the upper extremities along with intermittent dystonic posturing of all extremities."

EXPLICIT: "The patient was evaluated at the NIH at age 9 and had advanced Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism with prominent and unpredictable 'on-off' fluctuations, peak-dose dyskinesia, stooped posture and disabling off-dystonia."

INFERRED: "Symptoms were severe enough to warrant a trial of Levodopa." (This suggests Parkinsonism symptoms.)

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Specifically, the patient was compound heterozygous for 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_015836.3): a missense variant c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly) that was inherited from his mother and a missense variant c.683C>G (p.Ser228Trp) that was inherited from his father."

INFERRED: "The patient, following informed and written consent, was admitted in the NIH Clinical Center under the protocol 76-HG-0238..." (This suggests a single compound heterozygous individual was reported in this study.)

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 and a clinical presentation of infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism."

INFERRED: "The patient, following informed and written consent, under the protocol 76-HG-0238..." (This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.)

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. (The text describes a compound heterozygous mutation, not a simple heterozygous mutation.)

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 and a clinical presentation of infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism."

INFERRED: "The temporal pattern of our patientâ€™s clinical progression has followed the prototypical course of adult idiopathic PD, except that it began 6 decades earlier." (This suggests Parkinsonism symptoms.)

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."

INFERRED: "The patient, following informed and written consent, under the protocol 76-HG-0238..." (This suggests a single compound heterozygous individual was reported in this study.)
