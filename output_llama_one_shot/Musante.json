All affected children were born at full term after uneventful pregnancies, followed by a normal neonatal period. Testing of cognitive function using the Wechsler Adult Intel-ligence Scale (WAIS-IV) showed an intelligence quotient (IQ) 40\u201345 in the range of moderate ID, speech impairment (slow and slurred speech) and aggressive behavior. In addition, the patients presented with microcephaly, ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7\u201310 years), and muscular weakness (since the age of 6\u201310). All patients developed tonic-clonic seizures during infancy, which are well controlled by sodium valproate."

Two affected siblings (V:7 and V:8) presented with moderate ID (IQ = 41\u201346), athetosis, aggressive behavior, and speech impairment (slow and slurred speech). Moreover muscular weakness and ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7\u201310 years) were observed."
