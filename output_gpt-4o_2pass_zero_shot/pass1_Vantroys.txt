## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay..." - This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)." - The presence of two different pathogenic variants suggests compound heterozygosity rather than simple heterozygosity.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability"  
EXPLICIT: "epileptic seizure"  
EXPLICIT: "acute liver failure and severe progressive encephalopathy"  
INFERRED: "mild dysmorphic facial features were initially suggestive of cerebral palsy or a chromosomal disorder as she was slightly dysmorphic."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

INFERRED: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)." - This indicates the proband is a compound heterozygote, suggesting one individual with compound heterozygosity.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "The same fractions were prepared from liver from the proband and controls." - This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836)." - The presence of compound heterozygous variants suggests there are no simple heterozygous probands.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents. Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intra-uterine growth retardation."  
EXPLICIT: "severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs"  
EXPLICIT: "slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum."  
EXPLICIT: "Brain MRI showed a relative small volume of both frontotemporal lobes, enlarged sulci and small zones with increased signal bilaterally on T2 weighted images in the frontal subcortical zones."  
EXPLICIT: "severe delay of cognitive and motor development"  
EXPLICIT: "no head control and rigidity of arms and legs"  
EXPLICIT: "optic atrophy"  
EXPLICIT: "Cerebral MRI showed enlargement of the lateral ventricles and third ventricle presumably due to white matter loss."  
EXPLICIT: "She was diagnosed with acute liver failure (ALF) and metabolic encephalopathy."  
EXPLICIT: "episodes with decreased awareness occurred more frequently."  
EXPLICIT: "severe generalized amyotrophy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836)." - This explicitly indicates one individual with compound heterozygosity.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "Here, we report on a 6-year-old child with WARS2 deficiency." - This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text discusses compound heterozygosity, not simple heterozygosity.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability"  
EXPLICIT: "seizures"  
EXPLICIT: "acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy"  
INFERRED: "The phenotype of the subject reported here fits into the second phenotype (protracted course, early onset developmental delay, motor weakness, extra-pyramidal signs, epilepsy)."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity." - This explicitly indicates one individual with compound heterozygosity.

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "In the subject reported here, microscopic examination of liver showed a mosaic pattern after activity staining of cytochrome c oxidase." - This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text discusses compound heterozygosity, not simple heterozygosity.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "epilepsy, ptosis, hypoglycaemia, valproate induced hepatotoxicity"  
INFERRED: "Cerebral MRI in the proband also showed atrophy most prominent in the frontal regions and, in addition, atrophy of the vermis cerebelli, brainstem and cerebellar peduncles." - This suggests neurological involvement.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The identical compound heterozygous mutant genotype (p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ p.Lys313Met) was found in the two subjects with severe neonatal expression reported by Wortmann et al." - This explicitly indicates one individual with compound heterozygosity in this study.
