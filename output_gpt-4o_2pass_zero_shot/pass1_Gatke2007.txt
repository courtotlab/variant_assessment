## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."

INFERRED: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..." suggests that there are three probands in total, but only two were sequenced.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state that any of the probands were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, but the mention of a relative being heterozygous suggests the possibility of heterozygosity in the family.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

INFERRED: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..." suggests that the phenotype associated with the probands is prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: The text explicitly states that the proband in family 3 is compound heterozygous, indicating at least one compound heterozygote.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2)..."

INFERRED: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3)..." and "The proband (2-1) was not sequenced, but had previously been ascribed a phenotype as compound heterozygous..." suggest that there are three probands in total, one from each family.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3)."

INFERRED: The mention of patient 2-3 being heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 suggests that this is the only explicitly mentioned heterozygous proband.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1... displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine resulting in 3 hours of apnoea and hence postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit."

INFERRED: "The proband (2-1) was not sequenced, but had previously been ascribed a phenotype as compound heterozygous for the atypical variant and a silent variant using biochemical assays. This patient experienced prolonged duration of action of 360 min following succinylcholine." and "The proband in family 3... had experienced a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine of 90 min, which is six times the normal duration."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126..." and "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M..."

INFERRED: The text explicitly states that the proband in family 3 is compound heterozygous, indicating at least one compound heterozygote. Additionally, the proband in family 1 is described with two different mutations, suggesting compound heterozygosity.
