    "num_tested_probands": "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU... suggests that there are three probands in total, but only two were sequenced. Also, 'The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1\u20132)...' and 'The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3)...' confirm three probands.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "'One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2\u20133).' indicates one positive heterozygous proband.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "'In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine.' and other similar statements describe the phenotypes.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "'The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126...' and 'The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M.' indicate two compound heterozygotes."
