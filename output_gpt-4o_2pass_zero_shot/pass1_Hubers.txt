1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "A 31-year-old man was referred to our movement disorders outpatient clinic at the age of 30 years." - This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text describes the proband as having "biallelic variants in WARS2," which implies compound heterozygosity rather than simple heterozygosity.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

EXPLICIT: "a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits."

INFERRED: "ballistic movements and a stepwise loss of already acquired skills" - This suggests developmental regression.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "we prioritized genes carrying biallelic variants in the index and detected 2 variants in WARS2" - This indicates the proband is a compound heterozygote.

INFERRED: "The paternally inherited missense variant... The maternally inherited c.149G>A, p.Gly50Asp missense variant" - This further supports the presence of compound heterozygosity in the proband.
