    "num_tested_probands": "INFERRED: 'A 31-year-old man was referred to our movement disorders outpatient clinic at the age of 30 years.' - This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "No relevant information found. The text describes the proband as having 'biallelic variants in WARS2,' which implies compound heterozygosity rather than simple heterozygosity.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "EXPLICIT: 'a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism.'; EXPLICIT: 'a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits.'; INFERRED: 'ballistic movements and a stepwise loss of already acquired skills' - This suggests developmental regression.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "EXPLICIT: 'we prioritized genes carrying biallelic variants in the index and detected 2 variants in WARS2' - This indicates the proband is a compound heterozygote. INFERRED: 'The paternally inherited missense variant... The maternally inherited c.149G>A, p.Gly50Asp missense variant' - This further supports the presence of compound heterozygosity in the proband."
