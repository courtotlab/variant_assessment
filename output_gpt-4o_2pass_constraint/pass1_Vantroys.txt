## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay..." - This suggests a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)." - This indicates compound heterozygosity, not simple heterozygosity.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability" and "acute liver failure and severe progressive encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)." - This indicates 1 compound heterozygote.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents." - This suggests a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text describes compound heterozygosity, not simple heterozygosity.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents. Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intra-uterine growth retardation. Birth weight was 2314 g, length 45 cm and head circumference 31.8 cm. The neonatal period was without complications. When examined at the age of eleven months, severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs were noticed and she was found to have slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum." 

EXPLICIT: "When seen at eighteen months of age, a severe delay of cognitive and motor development was confirmed. The cognitive development was estimated at less than six months. She had no head control and rigidity of arms and legs was noticed. Fists were bilaterally clenched. Deep tendon reflexes were weak and both feet were in equinus position."

EXPLICIT: "At six years of age, she was hospitalized because of a long lasting episode with decreased awareness, lateral eye deviation and twitching of the eyelids at the left. Hypoglycemia and a slightly increased lactate (which turned out to be normal on the next day) were detected in serum on admission."

EXPLICIT: "She was diagnosed with acute liver failure (ALF) and metabolic encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836)." - This indicates 1 compound heterozygote.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "Here, we report on a 6-year-old child with WARS2 deficiency." - This suggests a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text describes compound heterozygosity, not simple heterozygosity.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proposita had presented at young age with developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability."

EXPLICIT: "She presented for the first time with seizures at the age of six years and a treatment with sodium valproate was initiated."

EXPLICIT: "During the next month, her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and ultimately she developed acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity." - This indicates 1 compound heterozygote.

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "In the subject reported here, microscopic examination of liver showed a mosaic pattern after activity staining of cytochrome c oxidase." - This suggests a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text describes compound heterozygosity, not simple heterozygosity.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Cerebral MRI in the proband also showed atrophy most prominent in the frontal regions and, in addition, atrophy of the vermis cerebelli, brainstem and cerebellar peduncles."

EXPLICIT: "In conclusion, we broaden the clinical spectrum of WARS2 deficiency and report for the first time a severe hepatopathy associated with valproate treatment in a subject with WARS2 deficiency."

INFERRED: "Interestingly, the proband was initially considered as having a non-specific, non-progressive encephalopathy, and it was only when she developed hepatopathy after valproate treatment was started that the diagnosis of a mitochondrial defect was made." - This suggests the phenotype includes non-specific encephalopathy and hepatopathy.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The identical compound heterozygous mutant genotype (p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ p.Lys313Met) was found in the two subjects with severe neonatal expression reported by Wortmann et al. (Table 2)." - This indicates 1 compound heterozygote in this study.
