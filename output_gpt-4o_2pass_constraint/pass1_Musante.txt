## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The text mentions "two unrelated Iranian families" and describes genetic findings in "the first family" and "the second family," suggesting that there are two probands tested, one from each family.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text describes "a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene" in the second family, implying that the proband from the second family is a positive heterozygous case.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In the first family, homozygosity mapping in combination with subsequent mutation screening revealed a homozygous missense mutation in the Seryl-tRNA Synthetase (SARS) gene (MIM# 607529), which co-segregates with moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene," indicating 1 compound heterozygote.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The text mentions "Family 1" and "Family 2," with specific individuals listed under each family, suggesting that there are multiple individuals tested within these families. However, the previously extracted quote inferred two probands, one from each family, based on the description of genetic findings in "the first family" and "the second family."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not provide explicit information about heterozygous probands in this section.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: The table lists clinical features for individuals from Family 1 and Family 2, including "Delayed psychomotor development," "Ataxia," "Muscle weakness," "Seizure," "Behavior problems," "Speech impairment," and "Intellectual disability."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: The table lists "WARS2 (NM_201263.2; NP_957715.1) mutations c.325delA (p.Ser109Alafs*159) c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly)" for Family 2-V:7 and Family 2-V:8, indicating compound heterozygous mutations in these individuals. This suggests there are 2 compound heterozygotes in Family 2.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "All affected children were born at full term after uneventful pregnancies, followed by a normal neonatal period. Testing of cognitive function using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) showed an intelligence quotient (IQ) 40–45 in the range of moderate ID, speech impairment (slow and slurred speech) and aggressive behavior. In addition, the patients presented with microcephaly, ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years), and muscular weakness (since the age of 6–10). All patients developed tonic–clonic seizures during infancy, which are well controlled by sodium valproate."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

INFERRED: The text mentions "compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene" in the second family, suggesting compound heterozygous mutations. The previously extracted quote indicated 2 compound heterozygotes in Family 2.

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The text mentions "family 1" and "family 2," with specific genetic findings described for each family, suggesting that there are two probands tested, one from each family.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not provide explicit information about heterozygous probands in this section.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In the SARS gene a homozygous G to A substitution...was found in exon five and results in a change from aspartic acid to asparagine at amino acid position 172...Only the amino acid substitution in SARS was predicted to be damaging and thus identified as the most plausible pathogenic change in family 1."

INFERRED: The text describes the mutation in the SARS gene as co-segregating with the disease in family 1, implying that the phenotype associated with this mutation includes the clinical features previously described for family 1, such as moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

No relevant information found. The text does not provide explicit information about compound or double heterozygous mutations in this section.

## Pages 11-12 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, whole genome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous genotype in affected individuals, consisting of a deleterious frame-shift mutation and a missense change (p.Trp13Gly) in the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase encoding WARS2."

INFERRED: The description of a compound heterozygous genotype in the second family suggests there is at least 1 compound heterozygote.
