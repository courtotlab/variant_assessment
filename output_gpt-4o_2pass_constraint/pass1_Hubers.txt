1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2..." and "A 31-year-old man was referred to our movement disorders outpatient clinic..." suggest a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text describes the proband as having "biallelic variants in WARS2" and mentions "The paternally inherited missense variant c.37T>G, p.(Trp13Gly)" and "The maternally inherited c.149G>A, p.Gly50Asp missense variant," indicating compound heterozygosity rather than simple heterozygosity. Therefore, there are no positive HET probands.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

INFERRED: "cognitive deficits," "developmental cognitive delay," and "absence of this clinical finding [epileptic seizures] might explain the survival beyond 25 years in our patient."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

INFERRED: "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2..." and the description of "The paternally inherited missense variant c.37T>G, p.(Trp13Gly)" and "The maternally inherited c.149G>A, p.Gly50Asp missense variant" suggest 1 compound heterozygote.

1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "Video S1. Clinical presentation of the 31-year-old patient in the movement disorders outpatient clinic in 2018..." and "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2..." suggest a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The previously extracted information indicates compound heterozygosity, not simple heterozygosity.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Video S1. Clinical presentation of the 31-year-old patient in the movement disorders outpatient clinic in 2018 showing a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable dystonic and ballistic movements."

INFERRED: "He can communicate nonverbally with the parents on a basic level and react to orders," suggesting cognitive deficits.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

INFERRED: "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2..." and the description of "The paternally inherited missense variant c.37T>G, p.(Trp13Gly)" and "The maternally inherited c.149G>A, p.Gly50Asp missense variant" suggest 1 compound heterozygote.
