1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."

INFERRED: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..." suggests three probands were involved in the study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "one was heterozygous for the atypical and a silent variant (AS)."

INFERRED: The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126, suggesting the proband might have been heterozygous as well.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

INFERRED: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..." suggests the phenotype of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: No additional information suggesting more than one compound heterozygote.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2)..."

INFERRED: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3)..." and "The proband (2-1) was not sequenced..." suggest three probands were involved in the study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3)."

INFERRED: The mention of "heterozygous for BCHE*FS126" in family 2 suggests at least one positive HET proband.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine resulting in 3 hours of apnoea and hence postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit."

INFERRED: "experienced a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine of 90 min, which is six times the normal duration." and "experienced prolonged duration of action of 360 min following succinylcholine."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: No additional information suggesting more than one compound heterozygote.
