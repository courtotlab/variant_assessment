## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."

INFERRED: "Mention of 'the patient' suggesting a single proband."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp) who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years."

INFERRED: "This case expands the phenotypic spectrum of WARS2 deficiency and emphasizes the importance of mitochondrial protein synthesis in the pathogenesis of Parkinsonism."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp)..." 

INFERRED: "Mention of 'compound heterozygous mutations' suggesting a single individual with this genetic status."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "The patient was the first and only child born to non-consanguineous parents..." and "The patient, following informed and written consent, was admitted in the NIH Clinical Center..." These statements suggest a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Early development was normal until the age of 1 when he was first noted to have left leg tremor while learning to stand. At 18 months, the left leg tremor spread to his right leg and he was noted to have expressive language delay despite good receptive language skills. By 23 months, tremor had also become apparent in the upper extremities along with intermittent dystonic posturing of all extremities."

EXPLICIT: "The patient was evaluated at the NIH at age 9 and had advanced Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism with prominent and unpredictable 'on-off' fluctuations, peak-dose dyskinesia, stooped posture and disabling off-dystonia."

INFERRED: "Symptoms were severe enough to warrant a trial of Levodopa. After a trial dose of Levodopa, lower extremities tremor and dystonia disappeared for an entire day."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Specifically, the patient was compound heterozygous for 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_015836.3): a missense variant c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly) that was inherited from his mother and a missense variant c.683C>G (p.Ser228Trp) that was inherited from his father."

INFERRED: "Mention of 'compound heterozygous for 2 variants in WARS2' suggests a single individual with this genetic status."

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."

INFERRED: "Mention of 'the patient' suggesting a single proband."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 and a clinical presentation of infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism."

INFERRED: "The temporal pattern of our patient’s clinical progression has followed the prototypical course of adult idiopathic PD, except that it began 6 decades earlier."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."

INFERRED: "Mention of 'compound heterozygous mutations' suggesting a single individual with this genetic status."
