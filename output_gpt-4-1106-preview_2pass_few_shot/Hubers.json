    "num_tested_probands": "EXPLICIT: 'Here, we further increase the knowledge on the clinical presentation of WARS2 deficiency by presenting the first case with a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism.' INFERRED: The use of 'the first case' suggests that only one proband was tested and reported in this study.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "EXPLICIT: 'Based on the suspected autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, we prioritized genes carrying biallelic variants in the index and detected 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_201263.2).' INFERRED: Since the case describes biallelic variants, this implies that the proband is not heterozygous but rather homozygous or compound heterozygous. Therefore, there are no positive HET probands reported.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "EXPLICIT: 'a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism.' INFERRED: The proband's phenotype includes 'a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements.'",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state that the proband is a compound or double heterozygote, but the mention of 'biallelic variants' suggests that the proband has two different mutations, which would be consistent with a compound heterozygous state. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is 1 compound/double heterozygote."
