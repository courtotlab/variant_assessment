    "num_tested_probands": "The use of 'the case' suggests a single proband was tested.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "The proband is described as having 'compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2,' which implies that he is not a simple heterozygote but rather has two different mutations, one on each allele of the gene.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "Phenotypes are explicitly mentioned as 'infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years.' Additional phenotypes are inferred from the detailed clinical description.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "Since the text refers to 'the case of a 17-year-old boy' with compound heterozygous mutations, it can be inferred that there is one individual who is a compound heterozygote."
