## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp) who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years."

INFERRED: The use of "the case" suggests a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: The proband is described as having "compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2," which implies that he is not a simple heterozygote but rather has two different mutations, one on each allele of the gene. Therefore, there are no positive HET probands reported as simple heterozygotes.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2... who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp)"
INFERRED: Since the text refers to "the case of a 17-year-old boy" with compound heterozygous mutations, it can be inferred that there is one individual who is a compound heterozygote.

INFERRED: The use of "the case" suggests a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years."
INFERRED: Additional phenotypes can be inferred from the detailed clinical description, including "left leg tremor," "expressive language delay," "intermittent dystonic posturing of all extremities," "motor complications of more advanced PD including peak-dose and wearing-off phenomena with disabling retrocollic dystonic spasms," and "advanced Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism with prominent and unpredictable 'on-off' fluctuations, peak-dose dyskinesia, stooped posture and disabling off-dystonia."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "compound heterozygous for 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_015836.3): a missense variant c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly) that was inherited from his mother and a missense variant c.683C>G (p.Ser228Trp) that was inherited from his father."
INFERRED: Since the text refers to "the case of a 17-year-old boy" with compound heterozygous mutations, it can be inferred that there is one individual who is a compound heterozygote.
