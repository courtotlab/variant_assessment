## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, but it mentions that "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126." This suggests that there may be at least one heterozygous proband, but since the proband in family 2 was not sequenced, it is not confirmed if they are heterozygous.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M. In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
INFERRED: Since the text explicitly mentions one proband in family 3 as compound heterozygous, we can infer that there is at least one compound/double heterozygote. There is no mention of other individuals with compound heterozygosity, so the number is inferred to be 1.

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126 and displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine resulting in 3 hours of apnoea and hence postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M, the latter mutation also known as the H-variant."
INFERRED: The text mentions probands from three families, suggesting that there were at least three probands tested. However, it is explicitly stated that the proband in family 2 was not sequenced, so the exact number of probands tested with genetic sequencing is uncertain.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3)." This suggests that there is at least one positive HET proband. However, it is not clear if this patient is the proband or a relative, as the proband in family 2 was not sequenced.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126 and displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine resulting in 3 hours of apnoea and hence postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M, the latter mutation also known as the H-variant. BChE activity was below detection limit, and the patient had experienced a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine of 90 min, which is six times the normal duration."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M, the latter mutation also known as the H-variant."
INFERRED: Since the text explicitly mentions one proband in family 3 as compound heterozygous, we can infer that there is at least one compound/double heterozygote. There is no mention of other individuals with compound heterozygosity, so the number is inferred to be 1.
