    "num_tested_probands": "The use of 'The patient' suggests a single proband.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, implying no positive HET probands in this study.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "The patient is described as healthy, which suggests the absence of a clinical phenotype related to the genetic condition being studied.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "Since only one patient is mentioned as being compound heterozygous, it can be inferred that there is 1 compound/double heterozygote."
