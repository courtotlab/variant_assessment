1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Here, we further increase the knowledge on the clinical presentation of WARS2 deficiency by presenting the first case with a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

INFERRED: The use of "the first case" suggests that only one proband was tested and reported in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "Based on the suspected autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, we prioritized genes carrying biallelic variants in the index and detected 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_201263.2)."

INFERRED: Since the case describes biallelic variants, this implies that the proband is not heterozygous but rather homozygous or compound heterozygous. Therefore, there are no positive HET probands reported.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

INFERRED: The proband's phenotype includes "a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state that the proband is a compound or double heterozygote, but the mention of "biallelic variants" suggests that the proband has two different mutations, which would be consistent with a compound heterozygous state. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is 1 compound/double heterozygote.

No relevant information found for explicit statements regarding the number of compound/double heterozygotes.
