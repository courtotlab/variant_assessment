    "num_positive_het_probands": "INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, but it mentions that 'The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126.' This suggests that there may be at least one heterozygous proband, but since the proband in family 2 was not sequenced, it is not confirmed if they are heterozygous.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "EXPLICIT: 'The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M. In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine.'",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "EXPLICIT: 'whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M.' INFERRED: Since the text explicitly mentions one proband in family 3 as compound heterozygous, we can infer that there is at least one compound/double heterozygote. There is no mention of other individuals with compound heterozygosity, so the number is inferred to be 1."
