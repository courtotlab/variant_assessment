## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man..."
INFERRED: The use of "The patient" suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man..."
INFERRED: The patient is described as healthy, which suggests the absence of a clinical phenotype related to the genetic condition being studied.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozyous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."
INFERRED: Since only one patient is mentioned as being compound heterozygous, it can be inferred that there is 1 compound/double heterozygote.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Retrospectively, the patient gave written informed consent to publish the results and permission to ask his family to participate in a pedigree analysis."
INFERRED: The use of "the patient" suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation." This implies that there are no positive HET probands in this study, as the patient and one brother are homozygous, not heterozygous.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
No relevant information found.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Thus, the patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations."
INFERRED: Since only one patient is mentioned as being compound heterozygous, it can be inferred that there is 1 compound/double heterozygote.
