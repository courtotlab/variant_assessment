    "num_tested_probands": "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) scheduled for correction of the inner nose.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "This article presents the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a normal dose of mivacurium in a patient with phenotype SS, along with a pedigree analysis and description of the molecular genetic method (complete nucleotide sequencing of BCHE) used to identify the genotype, i.e., compound heterozygous occurrence for two silent mutations.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene. Thus, the patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations. Accordingly, the parents are both heterozygous for one silent mutation. One brother has the same genotype as the patient, whereas another brother is heterozygous for the S7 mutation.",
    "explanation": "Information was extracted from the provided genetic case report."
