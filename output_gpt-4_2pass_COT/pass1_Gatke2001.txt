## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) scheduled for correction of the inner nose."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "This article presents the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a normal dose of mivacurium in a patient with phenotype SS, along with a pedigree analysis and description of the molecular genetic method (complete nucleotide sequencing of BCHE) used to identify the genotype, i.e., compound heterozygous occurrence for two silent mutations."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Retrospectively, the patient gave written informed consent to publish the results and permission to ask his family to participate in a pedigree analysis."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The patient’s BChE activity was zero, indicating that he was homozygous for silent mutations."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Thus, the patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations. Accordingly, the parents are both heterozygous for one silent mutation. One brother has the same genotype as the patient, whereas another brother is heterozygous for the S7 mutation."
