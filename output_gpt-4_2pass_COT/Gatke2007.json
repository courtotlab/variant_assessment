    "num_tested_probands": "As the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established with certainty using conventional biochemical tests, DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126. One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2\u20133).",
    "positive_phenotypes": "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M. In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine. The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1\u20132) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126 and displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine resulting in 3 hours of apnoea and hence postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit. The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M, the latter mutation also known as the H-variant. BChE activity was below detection limit, and the patient had experienced a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine of 90 min, which is six times the normal duration.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M. The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M. The proband (2-1) was not sequenced, but had previously been ascribed a phenotype as compound heterozygous for the atypical variant and a silent variant using biochemical assays."
