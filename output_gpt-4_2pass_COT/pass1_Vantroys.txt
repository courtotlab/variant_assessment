1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability..."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability..."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The same fractions were prepared from liver from the proband and controls."

INFERRED: The text refers to "the proband" in singular form, suggesting that only one proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "When examined at the age of eleven months, severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs were noticed and she was found to have slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum." 

EXPLICIT: "When seen at eighteen months of age, a severe delay of cognitive and motor development was confirmed. The cognitive development was estimated at less than six months. She had no head control and rigidity of arms and legs was noticed. Fists were bilaterally clenched."

EXPLICIT: "At six years of age, she was hospitalized because of a long lasting episode with decreased awareness, lateral eye deviation and twitching of the eyelids at the left."

EXPLICIT: "She was diagnosed with acute liver failure (ALF) and metabolic encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836). The first variant (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10) was a single nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift and premature stopcodon. The second variant (c.938 A > T, p.Lys313Met) was a missense variant."

INFERRED: "The same fractions were prepared from liver from the proband and controls."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a 6-year-old child with WARS2 deficiency. The proposita had presented at young age with developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability. Her condition remained stable for several years until she presented for the first time with seizures at the age of six years and a treatment with sodium valproate was initiated. During the next month, her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and ultimately she developed acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing using variant-specific primers. Due to the close proximity of the two variants, biallelic state could be determined. A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity. This primer pair resulted in a PCR fragment containing both variants. As the position of the missense variant was not affected by the deletion, both variants were located on a different allele."
