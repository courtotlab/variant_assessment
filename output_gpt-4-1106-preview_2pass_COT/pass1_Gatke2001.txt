1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man [...] He reported no medications and had no known history of allergies. The patient had been anesthetized previously without any known complications, and low BChE activity was not suspected."
INFERRED: The text refers to "the patient" in singular form, suggesting a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man [...] He reported no medications and had no known history of allergies. The patient had been anesthetized previously without any known complications, and low BChE activity was not suspected."
INFERRED: The patient did not exhibit any clinical phenotypes associated with the genetic condition being studied, as he was described as healthy and without known complications related to low BChE activity.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."
INFERRED: There is one individual reported to have compound heterozygous mutations.

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Retrospectively, the patient gave written informed consent to publish the results and permission to ask his family to participate in a pedigree analysis."
INFERRED: The text continues to refer to "the patient" in singular form, suggesting a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation." This implies that there are three heterozygous individuals (father, mother, and one brother), but it is not explicitly stated if they are probands or if their heterozygosity is associated with a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The patientâ€™s BChE activity was zero, indicating that he was homozygous for silent mutations."
INFERRED: Since the patient is homozygous rather than heterozygous, the phenotype of zero BChE activity is not associated with a positive heterozygous proband. No other explicit phenotypes for heterozygous individuals are mentioned in this excerpt.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Thus, the patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations."
INFERRED: "One brother has the same genotype as the patient," suggesting that there are at least two individuals reported to have compound heterozygous mutations.
