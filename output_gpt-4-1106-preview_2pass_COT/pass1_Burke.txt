## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2" - This quote indicates that a single proband, a 17-year-old boy, was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp) who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years." - This quote provides the phenotype of the proband as "infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp)" - This quote explicitly states that the proband is a compound heterozygote, indicating there is one individual with compound heterozygous mutations.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was the first and only child born to non-consanguineous parents of European descent with no relevant family history." - This quote suggests that a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Early development was normal until the age of 1 when he was first noted to have left leg tremor while learning to stand. At 18 months, the left leg tremor spread to his right leg and he was noted to have expressive language delay despite good receptive language skills. By 23 months, tremor had also become apparent in the upper extremities along with intermittent dystonic posturing of all extremities." - This quote provides the phenotype of the proband as having tremors and dystonic posturing of extremities, as well as expressive language delay.

EXPLICIT: "The patient was evaluated at the NIH at age 9 and had advanced Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism with prominent and unpredictable 'on-off' fluctuations, peak-dose dyskinesia, stooped posture and disabling off-dystonia." - This quote provides the phenotype of the proband as having advanced Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism with additional symptoms including 'on-off' fluctuations, peak-dose dyskinesia, stooped posture, and disabling off-dystonia.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Specifically, the patient was compound heterozygous for 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_015836.3): a missense variant c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly) that was inherited from his mother and a missense variant c.683C>G (p.Ser228Trp) that was inherited from his father." - This quote explicitly states that the proband is compound heterozygous for two variants in WARS2, indicating there is one individual with compound heterozygous mutations.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2" - This quote indicates that a single proband, the fourth patient, was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 and a clinical presentation of infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism."

INFERRED: The phenotypes associated with the proband in this study are inferred to be "infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism," as explicitly mentioned in the text. However, since the proband has compound heterozygous mutations, this information may not be relevant to the question as it pertains to positive heterozygotes (single allele mutation carriers).

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2" - This quote explicitly states that the proband has compound heterozygous mutations, indicating there is one individual with compound heterozygous mutations.
