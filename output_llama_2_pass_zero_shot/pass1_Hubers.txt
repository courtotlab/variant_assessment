## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "19 different mitochondrial tRNA synthetases exist and are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis."

INFERRED: The text mentions that 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, but it does not explicitly state the number of probands tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that "in combination with a more deleterious variant, this variant [c.37T>G] has been found in association with disease and is hence considered a hypomorphic allele." However, it does not provide information on the number of heterozygous probands.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic movements and dystonic movements."

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient showed a "severe hyperkinetic movement disorder" and had "dystonic movements" since the age of 2 years.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on the number of individuals reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations. However, it mentions that the patient had "biallelic variants" in WARS2 and that one variant was paternally inherited and the other maternally inherited.

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: None
INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the number of probands tested, but it mentions that 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the number of heterozygous probands, but it mentions that one variant was paternally inherited and the other maternally inherited, suggesting a single heterozygous case.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic movements and dystonic movements."
INFERRED: The text also mentions that the patient showed a "severe hyperkinetic movement disorder" and had "dystonic movements" since the age of 2 years.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the number of individuals reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations, but it mentions that the patient had "biallelic variants" in WARS2 and that one variant was paternally inherited and the other maternally inherited.
