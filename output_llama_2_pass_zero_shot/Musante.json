    "num_tested_probands": "The study mentions that 'ethnically matched unrelated healthy individuals as well as unre-related healthy German individuals were also directly screened for the mutations.' This suggests that multiple probands may have been tested.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "The study does not provide explicit information on the number of heterozygous (HET) probands. However, it mentions that 'siblings and parents were also sequenced, when available' to confirm co-segregation of the allele within the families. This suggests that multiple family members may have been tested for the mutation.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "The study mentions that the probands exhibited a range of symptoms, including moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior. This suggests that multiple phenotypes may have been observed in the probands.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The study does not provide explicit information on the number of individuals reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations. However, it mentions that 'the frameshift mutation on the paternal allele (c.325delA, p.Ser109Alafs*159) very likely leads to the degradation of WARS2 mRNA by NMD.' This suggests that at least one individual may have been reported as having a compound heterozygous genotype."
