## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: The text mentions that "The patient, following informed and written consent, under the protocol 76-HG-0238, “Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism or Other Genetic Disorders” of the NIH-UDP." This suggests that there is only one proband being tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "Here, we describe a patient with pathogenic WARS2 mutations presenting with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on the number of heterozygous (HET) probands specifically. However, it mentions that the patient has compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism"

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on other phenotypes associated with the proband. It only mentions the specific phenotype of infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Here, we describe a patient with pathogenic WARS2 mutations presenting with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism."

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient has "compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2" (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp). This suggests that there is only one individual reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations.

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient has "compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2" (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp). This suggests that there is only one individual reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations.

Note: There is some ambiguity in the answer for question 2, as the text does not explicitly state whether the patient has a single heterozygous mutation or multiple heterozygous mutations. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the patient has compound heterozygous mutations, which implies a single individual with two heterozygous mutations.

However, based on the information provided, it appears that the patient has compound heterozygous mutations, which implies a single individual with two heterozygous mutations.

Uncertainty/Ambiguity:
- The text does not provide explicit information on the number of heterozygous (HET) probands.
- The text mentions that "it is not uncommon for mtARS defects to have no effect on RC subunit expression in patient fibroblasts." This suggests that there may be other patients with WARS2 mutations who do not exhibit significant changes in RC subunit expression.

Based on the provided information, I was unable to find any explicit quotes or clues that would allow me to accurately answer question 2. Therefore, I will label it as:

No relevant information found for question 2.
