1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine...DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."
INFERRED: The text mentions three probands from unrelated families, but DNA samples were collected from two of them and four relatives, suggesting a total of 3 probands tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
INFERRED: Two probands were identified as positive HET probands: one in family 1 with BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126 and one in family 3 with BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
EXPLICIT: "Phenotypes: AS, heterozygous for the atypical variant and a silent variant; SS, homozygous for silent variants; UA, heterozygous for the atypical variant; US, heterozygous for a silent variant; UU, wild-type."
INFERRED: The positive proband phenotypes include AS (heterozygous for the atypical variant and a silent variant), SS (homozygous for silent variants), UA (heterozygous for the atypical variant), US (heterozygous for a silent variant), and UU (wild-type).

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
INFERRED: Two compound heterozygotes were reported in the study.
