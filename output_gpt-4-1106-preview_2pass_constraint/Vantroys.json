    "num_tested_probands": "Throughout the report, references to 'the proband' or 'the subject' in the singular form suggest that only one individual was tested and studied.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "The report does not explicitly state that the proband is heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, and no information is provided to infer the presence of positive HET probands.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "The report provides a detailed description of the proband's clinical presentation, including developmental delays, motor weakness, intellectual disability, and various other features and complications.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The report mentions the detection of two known pathogenic variants in the WARS2 gene in the proband, suggesting that the proband is a compound heterozygote. Additionally, the report discusses the use of a third primer pair designed to confirm compound heterozygosity.",
    "explanation": "The information was extracted from the provided case report, with specific quotes and inferences based on the context and descriptions given."
