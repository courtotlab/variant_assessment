These statements suggest a single proband.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "we prioritized genes carrying biallelic variants in the index and detected 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_201263.2). This implies that the proband has two different variants, one from each parent, which would not be considered heterozygous (HET) but rather compound heterozygous. Therefore, there are no positive HET probands reported.",

This suggests that the proband is a compound heterozygote, having two different pathogenic variants, one inherited from each parent. Therefore, there is 1 compound/double heterozygote."
