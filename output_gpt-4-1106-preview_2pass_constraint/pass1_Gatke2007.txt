1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."

INFERRED: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..." suggests that there were three probands in total, although DNA samples were only collected from two of them.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126." This implies that there was at least one proband who was a relative of the heterozygous individual, although it is not explicitly stated that the proband was heterozygous.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M. In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

INFERRED: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..." suggests that all probands experienced prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine, which is a clinical phenotype.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: No additional information found to infer other compound/double heterozygotes.

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126..."
EXPLICIT: "The mutation BCHE*FS126 also occurred in the unrelated family 2 (Table 1). One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3). The proband (2-1) was not sequenced..."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M..."

INFERRED: The mention of "The proband in family 1," "The proband (2-1) was not sequenced," and "The proband in family 3" suggests that there were at least three probands tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3)."

INFERRED: No additional explicit information found to infer other positive HET probands.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126 and displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine resulting in 3 hours of apnoea and hence postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit."
EXPLICIT: "This patient experienced prolonged duration of action of 360 min following succinylcholine."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M, the latter mutation also known as the H-variant. BChE activity was below detection limit, and the patient had experienced a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine of 90 min, which is six times the normal duration."

INFERRED: No additional inferred phenotypes beyond the explicit statements provided.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M..."

INFERRED: No additional information found to infer other compound/double heterozygotes.
