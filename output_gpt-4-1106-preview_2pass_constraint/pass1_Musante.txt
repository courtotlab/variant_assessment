## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: The text mentions "In the first family" and "In the second family," suggesting that there are at least two probands tested, one from each family.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The variant affects an amino acid residue that is highly conserved across the animal kingdom and it leads to unstable protein expression in mammalian cells. Moreover, the missense change leads to reduced enzymatic activity in vitro."
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."
INFERRED: The phenotypes associated with the probands in both families include "moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene."
INFERRED: Since the text mentions "compound DNA-alterations" in the context of the second family, it can be inferred that there is at least one individual with compound heterozygous mutations.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: The table lists six individuals from two families with specific mutations and clinical features, suggesting that at least six probands were tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: The table does not explicitly state the zygosity of the mutations for Family 1 individuals (III:4, III:10, III:9, III:11), but it does mention compound mutations for Family 2 individuals (V:7, V:8), which implies that the Family 1 individuals might be heterozygous for the listed SARS mutation. However, without explicit confirmation of their zygosity, this remains uncertain.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "WARS2 (NM_201263.2; NP_957715.1) mutations c.325delA (p.Ser109Alafs*159) c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly)" for individuals Family 2-V:7 and Family 2-V:8.
INFERRED: Since two individuals from Family 2 (V:7 and V:8) are listed with two different mutations in the WARS2 gene, it can be inferred that there are at least two compound heterozygotes.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of the patients (III:4, III:9, III:10, III:11), three healthy siblings and their parents, using standard procedures." This suggests that four probands were tested from Family 1.
INFERRED: "The consanguineous healthy parents had nine children, three of them with ID (Fig. 1B). One affected male (V:6) had died from an infectious disease. Two affected siblings (V:7 and V:8) presented with moderate ID..." This suggests that at least two probands were tested from Family 2, as one had died.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "All affected children were born at full term after uneventful pregnancies, followed by a normal neonatal period. Testing of cognitive function using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) showed an intelligence quotient (IQ) 40–45 in the range of moderate ID, speech impairment (slow and slurred speech) and aggressive behavior. In addition, the patients presented with microcephaly, ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years), and muscular weakness (since the age of 6–10). All patients developed tonic–clonic seizures during infancy, which are well controlled by sodium valproate."
EXPLICIT: "Two affected siblings (V:7 and V:8) presented with moderate ID (IQ = 41–46), athetosis, aggressive behavior, and speech impairment (slow and slurred speech). Moreover muscular weakness and ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years) were observed."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information about additional compound/double heterozygotes beyond those already identified from previous extractions.

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of the patients, two healthy siblings and their parents, using standard procedures." This suggests that multiple probands were tested, but the exact number is not specified in this quote.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
INFERRED: The mention of "affected individuals with ID" in the context of the pedigrees suggests that intellectual disability (ID) is a phenotype associated with the probands. Additionally, the reference to "the respective index patients" implies that the index patients, or probands, have been affected in a way that is significant to the study, likely including the presence of ID and potentially other phenotypes.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
No relevant information found.

## Pages 9-10 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the WARS2 gene in the affected individuals of family 2." This suggests that there were multiple affected individuals in family 2 who were tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
INFERRED: "Compound heterozygous WARS2 mutation in family 2" and the detailed description of the WARS2 gene's function and the effects of the mutations suggest that the probands have phenotypes related to the WARS2 gene mutations, which include moderate intellectual disability (ID), ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior as previously extracted.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the WARS2 gene in the affected individuals of family 2." This indicates that there is more than one individual with compound heterozygous mutations in family 2.

## Pages 11-12 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "In the second family, whole genome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous genotype in affected individuals..." This suggests that multiple probands were tested in the second family.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "In this report, we describe putatively ID causing mutations in SARS and WARS2 in families with closely overlapping additional clinical features including moderate ID, speech impairment, seizures, ataxia, and muscular weakness."
INFERRED: The clinical features described, such as "moderate ID, speech impairment, seizures, ataxia, and muscular weakness," are associated with the probands being studied.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, whole genome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous genotype in affected individuals..."
INFERRED: Since the text mentions "compound heterozygous genotype in affected individuals" in the context of the second family, it can be inferred that there is more than one individual with compound heterozygous mutations.

## Pages 13-14 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "We are very grateful to the affected individuals and their family for their participation in the study." This suggests that multiple probands were tested, but the exact number is not specified in this quote.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
INFERRED: The discussion of the functional impact of mutations in SARS and WARS2, and their potential to lead to reduced translation rates and affect proteins containing high amounts of serine, selenocysteine, or tryptophan, suggests that the probands may exhibit phenotypes related to these functional impairments. However, no explicit phenotypes are mentioned in this quote.
INFERRED: The mention of "our patients" in the context of discussing the compound hypomorph similar to the Wars2−/L53F animal model suggests that the probands may share some phenotypic similarities with the animal model, which includes diminished cardiac angiogenesis and reduced coronary flow.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: "This suggests that Wars2−/L53 represents a compound hypomorph similar to the situation observed in our patients." This implies that the patients observed in the study may have a compound heterozygous condition similar to the animal model described, but it does not specify the number of such patients.
