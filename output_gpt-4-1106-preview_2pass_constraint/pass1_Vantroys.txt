1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability" suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability and who was considered during several years as having a non-progressive encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)." This quote suggests the presence of two different mutations in the WARS2 gene, which could imply that the subject is a compound heterozygote.
INFERRED: The use of "compound heterozygote" is not explicitly stated, but the presence of two distinct mutations in the WARS2 gene in the proband implies that the proband could be a compound heterozygote.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "from liver from the proband and controls" suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents. Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intrauterine growth retardation. Birth weight was 2314 g, length 45 cm and head circumference 31.8 cm. The neonatal period was without complications. When examined at the age of eleven months, severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs were noticed and she was found to have slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum."
EXPLICIT: "When seen at eighteen months of age, a severe delay of cognitive and motor development was confirmed."
EXPLICIT: "At six years of age, she was hospitalized because of a long lasting episode with decreased awareness, lateral eye deviation and twitching of the eyelids at the left."
EXPLICIT: "Dystonic posturing of the limbs together with motor hyperactivity and continuous choreatic movements were seen."
EXPLICIT: "Ophthalmological examination revealed optic atrophy."
EXPLICIT: "Cerebral MRI showed enlargement of the lateral ventricles and third ventricle presumably due to white matter loss. Subarachnoidal spaces were abnormally large, most marked in the frontal regions bilaterally. In the posterior fossa, the vermis cerebelli was hypoplastic, the fourth ventricle was enlarged and the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles were hypoplastic."
EXPLICIT: "She was diagnosed with acute liver failure (ALF) and metabolic encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "As the great majority of mitochondrial diseases follows a recessive mode of inheritance (after exclusion of mtDNA alterations), only variants that were homozygous or compound heterozygous were included. This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836)." This quote suggests that the proband has two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene, indicating that there is 1 compound heterozygote.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "Western blot analysis for WARS2 was performed in liver tissue from the proband and controls." This suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a 6-year-old child with WARS2 deficiency. The proposita had presented at young age with developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability."
EXPLICIT: "Her condition remained stable for several years until she presented for the first time with seizures at the age of six years and a treatment with sodium valproate was initiated."
EXPLICIT: "During the next month, her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and ultimately she developed acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy."
EXPLICIT: "Sodium valproate was stopped but nevertheless she became progressively more unconscious and died half a year later."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity. This primer pair resulted in a PCR fragment containing both variants. As the position of the missense variant was not affected by the deletion, both variants were located on a different allele." This suggests that the proband is a compound heterozygote, implying there is 1 compound heterozygote.

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "In the subject reported here," suggests a single proband.
INFERRED: "A defect in a nuclear encoded gene was suspected in the proposita" suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "In the subject reported here, microscopic examination of liver showed a mosaic pattern after activity staining of cytochrome c oxidase."
EXPLICIT: "Cerebral MRI in the proband also showed atrophy most prominent in the frontal regions and, in addition, atrophy of the vermis cerebelli, brainstem and cerebellar peduncles."
EXPLICIT: "In conclusion, we broaden the clinical spectrum of WARS2 deficiency and report for the first time a severe hepatopathy associated with valproate treatment in a subject with WARS2 deficiency."
INFERRED: "The presence of a subcomplex of complex V in our subject was therefore suggestive of an intramitochondrial protein synthesis defect." suggests a phenotype related to mitochondrial dysfunction.
INFERRED: "Interestingly, the proband was initially considered as having a non-specific, non-progressive encephalopathy, and it was only when she developed hepatopathy after valproate treatment was started that the diagnosis of a mitochondrial defect was made." suggests that the proband's phenotype includes encephalopathy and hepatopathy.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The identical compound heterozygous mutant genotype (p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ p.Lys313Met) was found in the two subjects with severe neonatal expression reported by Wortmann et al. (Table 2)." This quote suggests that there are at least two compound heterozygotes reported in the literature, but it is not clear if this includes the subject of this study.
INFERRED: "The third subject with neonatal phenotype in the series reported by the same group was compound heterozygous for p.Lys31_Gln116del and Val349Leu [10]." This suggests another compound heterozygote, but again, it is not clear if this includes the subject of this study.
INFERRED: "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity." This suggests that the proband is a compound heterozygote, implying there is 1 compound heterozygote in this study.
