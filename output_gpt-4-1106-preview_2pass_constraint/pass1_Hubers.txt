1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "A 31-year-old man was referred to our movement disorders outpatient clinic..." and "Here, we further increase the knowledge on the clinical presentation of WARS2 deficiency by presenting the first case with a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism." These statements suggest a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: "we prioritized genes carrying biallelic variants in the index and detected 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_201263.2)." This implies that the proband has two different variants, one from each parent, which would not be considered heterozygous (HET) but rather compound heterozygous. Therefore, there are no positive HET probands reported.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements," "cognitive deficits," "a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism," and "developmental cognitive delay and complex movement disorders seem to be a consistent feature."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: "we prioritized genes carrying biallelic variants in the index and detected 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_201263.2)." This suggests that the proband is a compound heterozygote, having two different pathogenic variants, one inherited from each parent. Therefore, there is 1 compound/double heterozygote.

1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "Clinical presentation of the 31-year-old patient in the movement disorders outpatient clinic in 2018 showing a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable dystonic and ballistic movements." This statement, along with previously extracted information, suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable dystonic and ballistic movements."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: "Clinical presentation of the 31-year-old patient in the movement disorders outpatient clinic in 2018 showing a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable dystonic and ballistic movements." This statement, along with previously extracted information, suggests that there is 1 compound/double heterozygote.
