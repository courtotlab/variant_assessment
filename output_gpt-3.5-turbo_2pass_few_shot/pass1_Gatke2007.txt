## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine...DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."
EXPLICIT: "Genotypes were determined using complete nucleotide sequencing."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "a member had experienced severely prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."
EXPLICIT: "Hereditary low BChE activity may result in an extensively prolonged duration of action of these drugs, especially in patients who are homozygous for the atypical or silent variants."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
