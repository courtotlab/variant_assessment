1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man"
EXPLICIT: "Methods: The neuromuscular block following administration of mivacurium, at a dose of 0.14 mg/kg, was monitored in a 30-yr-old healthy man"
EXPLICIT: "Results: A train-of-four ratio of 0.75 was reached 469 min after the injection of mivacurium."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "Results: Complete nucleotide sequencing revealed two point mutations, the known silent variant S7 and a previously undescribed mutation of amino acid residue 170 introducing a stop codon."
EXPLICIT: "Conclusions: The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Background: Patients who are homozygous for the atypical mutation, compound heterozygous for atypical and silent mutations, or homozygous for silent mutations (SS) respond to mivacurium with extensively prolonged neuromuscular block."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Conclusions: The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."
