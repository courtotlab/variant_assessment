    "num_tested_probands": "EXPLICIT: 'Three novel mutations were identified: BCHE*FS126, BCHE*I3E4-14C and BCHE*328D.' INFERRED: The text mentions that DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives, suggesting that there are at least five individuals being studied.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "EXPLICIT: 'In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine.' INFERRED: The text mentions that the proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, suggesting that this individual is heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "EXPLICIT: 'In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine.' INFERRED: The text mentions that the proband in family 1 had a phenotype of 'SS' (homozygous for silent variants), suggesting that this individual has a positive phenotype.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "EXPLICIT: 'The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M.' INFERRED: The text mentions that the proband in family 2 had a relative who was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126, but it does not provide information on whether this individual is also heterozygous for another pathogenic variant."
