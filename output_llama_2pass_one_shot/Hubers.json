The exact number cannot be determined from the text.",

    "positive_phenotypes": "EXPLICIT: None, INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient showed a 'severe hyperkinetic movement disorder' but does not provide an exhaustive list of all positive phenotypes. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the patient's phenotype includes: * Hyperkinetic movement disorder * Ballistic movements * Dystonic movements",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "EXPLICIT: None, INFERRED: The text states that 'the patient received symptomatic treatment with tiapridhydro-chloride up to 450 mg per day, which reduced the occurrence and the amplitude of the hyperkinetic movements' but does not explicitly state the number of compound or double heterozygotes. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that there is at least one individual reported as 'compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M', which suggests a total of 1 compound/double heterozygote."
