## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The index patient (V:1) was sequenced, and siblings and parents were also sequenced, when available."

INFERRED: The study mentions that DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the number of heterozygous (HET) probands, but it mentions that "the proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: 
- "moderate ID"
- "microcephaly"
- "ataxia"
- "speech impairment"
- "aggressive behavior"

INFERRED: The study mentions that the probands in both families exhibited similar accompanying features, including moderate intellectual disability, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the number of compound or double heterozygous individuals, but it mentions that "the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
