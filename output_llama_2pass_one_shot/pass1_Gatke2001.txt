## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) scheduled for correction of the inner nose."

INFERRED: The text mentions that DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives, suggesting that there may be multiple individuals involved in the study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of positive HET probands, but it mentions that one relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The patient had a phenotype SS (silent mutations)."

EXPLICIT: "He was observed in the intensive care unit for a further 3 h, after which he was discharged to the surgical ward."

INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the positive proband phenotypes. However, it mentions that patients with phenotype SS respond to mivacurium with extensively prolonged durations of action.

4. (There is no question 4 in your original prompt.)

Note: There is no explicit quote or information provided for question 2, so I could not provide an EXPLICIT label.

## Pages 5-6 ##
The text discusses the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mivacurium in patients with silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) gene. The patient in the study had a phenotype SS (silent mutations) and was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the BCHE gene.

The ED95 (effective dose 95%) of mivacurium is estimated to be 16 mg/kg in patients with phenotype SS, which is higher than in patients homozygous for the atypical mutation AA. The authors also report that a dose of 140 mg/kg caused a prolonged block in the patient.

The pharmacokinetics of mivacurium were studied in the patient, and the concentrations of the cis-trans and trans-trans isomers were measured over time. The results showed that the active isomers were present in plasma up to 419 min after administration, which is much longer than in normal patients or patients with decreased BCHE activity.

The authors also discuss the pharmacodynamics of mivacurium in patients with silent mutations in the BCHE gene and note that there are no previous reports of pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic data on mivacurium in such patients.

Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided text:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."

INFERRED: The text mentions that DNA samples were collected from multiple individuals, suggesting that there may be more than one proband involved in the study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the number of positive HET probands. However, it mentions that one relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The patient had a phenotype SS (silent mutations)."

EXPLICIT: "He was observed in the intensive care unit for a further 3 h, after which he was discharged to the surgical ward."

INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the positive proband phenotypes. However, it mentions that patients with phenotype SS respond to mivacurium with extensively prolonged durations of action.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the number of compound/double heterozygotes. However, it mentions that one relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126.

Note: There is no question 4 in the original prompt, but I included it based on the provided text.
