## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "19 different mitochondrial tRNA synthetases exist and are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis."

INFERRED: The text mentions that 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, but it does not explicitly state the number of probands tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text states that "the patient received symptomatic treatment with tiapridhydro-chloride up to 450 mg per day, which reduced the occurrence and the amplitude of the hyperkinetic movements" but does not explicitly state the number of heterozygous probands.

However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that there is at least one heterozygous proband (the patient being studied).

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements."

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient showed a "severe hyperkinetic movement disorder" but does not provide an exhaustive list of all positive phenotypes.

However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the patient's phenotype includes:

* Hyperkinetic movement disorder
* Ballistic movements
* Dystonic movements

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text states that "the patient received symptomatic treatment with tiapridhydro-chloride up to 450 mg per day, which reduced the occurrence and the amplitude of the hyperkinetic movements" but does not explicitly state the number of compound or double heterozygotes.

However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that there is at least one individual reported as "compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M", which suggests a total of 1 compound/double heterozygote.

Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: None
INFERRED: The text mentions that "9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2" but does not explicitly state the number of probands tested.

However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that there is at least one individual being studied (the patient), and possibly others mentioned in the references or tables. The exact number cannot be determined from the text.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: None
INFERRED: As mentioned earlier, the text does not explicitly state the number of heterozygous probands. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that there is at least one heterozygous proband (the patient being studied).

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements."
