## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The patient, following informed and written consent, under the protocol 76-HG-0238, “Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism or Other Genetic Disorders” of the NIH-UDP."

INFERRED: The text mentions that clinical data and samples were obtained from the patient and his unaffected mother and father.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: There is no explicit mention of a single proband being heterozygous, but the text does mention that the patient's mother was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism"

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient presented with infantile-onset Parkinsonism and had decreased steady-state WARS2 protein in dermal fibroblasts.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: There is no explicit mention of any other patients being compound or double heterozygous, but the text does mention that the patient's mother was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126.

INFERRED: There is no explicit mention of any other patients being compound or double heterozygous, but the text does mention that the patient's mother was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126.

Note: The question "Number of probands tested" seems to be asking for the number of individuals with genetic testing reported in this study, which is not explicitly stated. However, based on the provided text, it appears that there is only one patient being studied (the proband).
