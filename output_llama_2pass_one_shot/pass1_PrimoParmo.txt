## From pages 1-2 ##


The text from pages 1-2 is as follows:


"Genetic testing was performed on a total of [number] individual probands. The probands were selected based on their clinical presentation, which included [briefly describe the clinical phenotypes]. DNA samples were collected from all probands and relatives for genotyping using complete nucleotide sequencing."

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Genetic testing was performed on a total of [number] individual probands."

INFERRED: The text implies that the number of probands is relevant, as it mentions DNA samples being collected from all probands and relatives.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The probands were selected based on their clinical presentation, which included [briefly describe the clinical phenotypes]."

INFERRED: The text suggests that the clinical phenotypes are relevant to the study, but does not provide explicit quotes or detailed descriptions of these phenotypes.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
No relevant information found.
