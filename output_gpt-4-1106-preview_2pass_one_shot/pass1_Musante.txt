## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "The probands were examined by experienced clinical geneticists who assessed their physical and mental status." This suggests that there were multiple probands, but the exact number is not explicitly stated.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The variant affects an amino acid residue that is highly conserved across the animal kingdom and it leads to unstable protein expression in mammalian cells. Moreover, the missense change leads to reduced enzymatic activity in vitro."
INFERRED: The phenotypes associated with the probands include "moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior" as these are the conditions mentioned in relation to the families studied.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene."
INFERRED: Since the text mentions "compound DNA-alterations" in the context of the second family, it can be inferred that there is at least one individual with compound heterozygous mutations. However, the exact number of such individuals is not explicitly stated. If there is only one proband described as having compound heterozygous mutations and no others are mentioned, it can be inferred as 1.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "Whole genome sequencing was performed in one affected (V:7)" and "Family 2 was part of a large study of the molecular basis of ARID and genotyping results of six DNA samples (IV:2, IV:3, V:2, V:7, V:8, V:9) from this family were used for homozygosity mapping and multipoint parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis." These statements suggest that multiple individuals from Family 2 were tested, but it is not clear if all are considered probands.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The phenotypes associated with the probands include 'moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior' as these are the conditions mentioned in relation to the families studied."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene."
INFERRED: Since the text mentions "compound DNA-alterations" in the context of the second family, it can be inferred that there is at least one individual with compound heterozygous mutations. However, the exact number of such individuals is not explicitly stated. If there is only one proband described as having compound heterozygous mutations and no others are mentioned, it can be inferred as 1.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of the patients (III:4, III:9, III:10, III:11), three healthy siblings and their parents, using standard procedures."
INFERRED: The mention of "the patients" in the context of family 1 suggests that there are multiple probands, specifically four, as indicated by the identifiers III:4, III:9, III:10, III:11.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "All affected children were born at full term after uneventful pregnancies, followed by a normal neonatal period. Testing of cognitive function using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) showed an intelligence quotient (IQ) 40–45 in the range of moderate ID, speech impairment (slow and slurred speech) and aggressive behavior. In addition, the patients presented with microcephaly, ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years), and muscular weakness (since the age of 6–10). All patients developed tonic–clonic seizures during infancy, which are well controlled by sodium valproate."
EXPLICIT: "Two affected siblings (V:7 and V:8) presented with moderate ID (IQ = 41–46), athetosis, aggressive behavior, and speech impairment (slow and slurred speech). Moreover muscular weakness and ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years) were observed."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: The previously extracted quote "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene." suggests that there is at least one individual with compound heterozygous mutations in family 2. However, the exact number of such individuals is not explicitly stated. If there is only one proband described as having compound heterozygous mutations and no others are mentioned, it can be inferred as 1.

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "The mutation affects a highly conserved amino acid (Fig. 1C) and, in line with this, the phyloP score (Pollard, Hubisz, Rosenbloom, & Siepel, 2010) was found to be 6.457." This suggests that the mutation was found in at least one proband, but the exact number of probands tested is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
No relevant information found in the provided text. However, previously extracted quotes indicate phenotypes such as "moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: "In the exonic regions of all 133 genes included in the interval, only two homozygous missense variants co-segregating with the disease in the family 1 were detected in the linkage interval on chromosome 1." This suggests that the probands in family 1 have homozygous variants, not compound or double heterozygous mutations. Therefore, there is no explicit mention of compound/double heterozygotes in the provided text for family 1. However, previously extracted quotes indicate at least one individual with compound heterozygous mutations in family 2.

## Pages 9-10 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the WARS2 gene in the affected individuals of family 2." This suggests that there were multiple probands in family 2, but the exact number is not explicitly stated.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
No new explicit information found in the provided text. However, previously extracted quotes indicate phenotypes such as "moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the WARS2 gene in the affected individuals of family 2." This indicates that there is at least one individual with a compound heterozygous mutation in family 2. If there is only one proband described as having compound heterozygous mutations and no others are mentioned, it can be inferred as 1.

## Pages 11-12 ##

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "In this report, we describe putatively ID causing mutations in SARS and WARS2 in families with closely overlapping additional clinical features including moderate ID, speech impairment, seizures, ataxia, and muscular weakness."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, whole genome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous genotype in affected individuals..." This indicates that there is at least one individual with a compound heterozygous mutation in the second family. If there is only one proband described as having compound heterozygous mutations and no others are mentioned, it can be inferred as 1.

## Pages 13-14 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "We are very grateful to the affected individuals and their family for their participation in the study." This suggests that there were multiple probands, but the exact number is not explicitly stated.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
INFERRED: "Functionally the mutations we found in SARS and WARS2 might lead to a reduced amount of charged tRNA available for translation at the ribosomes, which in turn could lead to a reduced translation rate, especially of those proteins that contain high amounts of serine, selenocysteine or tryptophan, respectively." This suggests that the probands may have phenotypes related to the effects of reduced translation rates of specific proteins, although specific clinical phenotypes are not explicitly mentioned in this excerpt.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: "Moreover, it has been shown that animals heterozygous (Wars2−/L53F) for the knockout allele and Wars2 p.Leu53Phe, a common variant in rat strains that is associated with a 40% reduction in Wars2 activity, revealed diminished cardiac angiogenesis and reduced coronary ﬂow as compared with animals with compound heterozygosity for the WT allele and the p.Leu53Phe allele (Wars2+/L53F)." This suggests that there is a comparison being made to compound heterozygosity in an animal model, but it does not provide explicit information about the number of compound/double heterozygotes in the human study.
