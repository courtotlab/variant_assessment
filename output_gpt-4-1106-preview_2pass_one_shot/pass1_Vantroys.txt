1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "Here, we present a 6-year-old girl..." suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state that the proband is heterozygous for the pathogenic variants, but the presence of two different mutations (c.797delC and c.938 A > T) suggests that the proband may be compound heterozygous rather than a positive HET proband with only one allele mutated.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability" and "she developed acute liver failure and severe progressive encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: The presence of two different mutations in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met) in the proband suggests that she may be a compound heterozygote. However, the text does not explicitly use the term "compound heterozygous" to describe her genetic status.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "The same fractions were prepared from liver from the proband and controls." This suggests a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents. Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intrauterine growth retardation. Birth weight was 2314 g, length 45 cm and head circumference 31.8 cm. The neonatal period was without complications. When examined at the age of eleven months, severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs were noticed and she was found to have slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum."
EXPLICIT: "Eye movements were complete. Pyramidal tract signs were not found. Length was 67 cm (−2.5 SD), weight 7.6 kg (−2 SD) and head circumference 45 cm (0 SD). Brain MRI showed a relative small volume of both frontotemporal lobes, enlarged sulci and small zones with increased signal bilaterally on T2 weighted images in the frontal subcortical zones."
EXPLICIT: "When seen at eighteen months of age, a severe delay of cognitive and motor development was confirmed. The cognitive development was estimated at less than six months. She had no head control and rigidity of arms and legs was noticed. Fists were bilaterally clenched. Deep tendon reflexes were weak and both feet were in equinus position."
EXPLICIT: "At six years of age, she was hospitalized because of a long lasting episode with decreased awareness, lateral eye deviation and twitching of the eyelids at the left."
EXPLICIT: "One month later, she was taken to a local hospital after she was found stuporous at home in the morning. Dystonic posturing of the limbs together with motor hyperactivity and continuous choreatic movements were seen."
EXPLICIT: "Ophthalmological examination revealed optic atrophy."
EXPLICIT: "Cerebral MRI showed enlargement of the lateral ventricles and third ventricle presumably due to white matter loss. Subarachnoidal spaces were abnormally large, most marked in the frontal regions bilaterally. In the posterior fossa, the vermis cerebelli was hypoplastic, the fourth ventricle was enlarged and the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles were hypoplastic."
EXPLICIT: "During the next months, episodes with decreased awareness occurred more frequently. When seen ambulatory at the child neurology department, she was stuporous with ptosis of the eyelids bilaterally and severe generalized amyotrophy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: "As the great majority of mitochondrial diseases follows a recessive mode of inheritance (after exclusion of mtDNA alterations), only variants that were homozygous or compound heterozygous were included." This suggests that the proband may be a compound heterozygote.
EXPLICIT: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836)." This confirms that the proband is a compound heterozygote.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "Here, we report on a 6-year-old child with WARS2 deficiency." This suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The proposita had presented at young age with developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability."
EXPLICIT: "Her condition remained stable for several years until she presented for the first time with seizures at the age of six years and a treatment with sodium valproate was initiated."
EXPLICIT: "During the next month, her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and ultimately she developed acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy."
EXPLICIT: "Sodium valproate was stopped but nevertheless she became progressively more unconscious and died half a year later."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity." This suggests that the proband is a compound heterozygote.
EXPLICIT: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836)." This confirms that the proband is a compound heterozygote.

1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: "In the subject reported here," suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "In the subject reported here, microscopic examination of liver showed a mosaic pattern after activity staining of cytochrome c oxidase."
EXPLICIT: "Cerebral MRI in the proband also showed atrophy most prominent in the frontal regions and, in addition, atrophy of the vermis cerebelli, brainstem and cerebellar peduncles."
INFERRED: The mention of "the subject reported here" and the description of the liver and brain MRI findings suggest these are phenotypes associated with the proband.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The identical compound heterozygous mutant genotype (p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ p.Lys313Met) was found in the two subjects with severe neonatal expression reported by Wortmann et al. (Table 2)."
INFERRED: The use of "compound heterozygous" in the context of the genotype found in the proband suggests that there is at least one compound heterozygote.
