## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, but it mentions "the proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126." This suggests that there may be at least one positive HET proband, but since the proband was not sequenced, this cannot be confirmed for the proband themselves.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."
INFERRED: The phenotypes of the probands are related to "prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine" due to "hereditary low BChE activity."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
INFERRED: Since only one individual is described as "compound heterozygous," we can infer that there is 1 compound/double heterozygote.

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126."
EXPLICIT: "The proband (2-1) was not sequenced, but had previously been ascribed a phenotype as compound heterozygous for the atypical variant and a silent variant using biochemical assays."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3)." This suggests that there is at least one positive HET proband, although it is not explicitly stated that this individual is a proband.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126 and displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine resulting in 3 hours of apnoea and hence postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M, the latter mutation also known as the H-variant. BChE activity was below detection limit, and the patient had experienced a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine of 90 min, which is six times the normal duration."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
INFERRED: Since only one individual is described as "compound heterozygous," we can infer that there is 1 compound/double heterozygote.
