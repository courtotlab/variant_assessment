This is a research article published in the journal Human Mutation, and it reports on the identification of mutations in two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) that are associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID).

Here's a summary of the article:

**Background**: Intellectual disability (ID) is a complex disorder with a wide range of phenotypes, and its molecular basis is heterogeneous. Many genes have been implicated in ARID, including ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes.

**Methods**: The study was conducted on two Iranian families affected by ARID. The authors used homozygosity mapping, next-generation sequencing, and Sanger sequencing to identify mutations in the SARS (Seryl-tRNA synthetase) and WARS2 (WARS2 tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase) genes.

**Results**: In the first family, a homozygous missense mutation (c.514G>A, p.Asp172Asn) was identified in the SARS gene, which co-segregates with moderate ID and other symptoms. The mutation affects the enzymatic core domain of the protein and impairs its activity, leading to reduced cytoplasmic tRNASer concentrations.

In the second family, a compound heterozygous genotype (c.325delA, p.Ser109Alafs*15) was identified in the WARS2 gene, which co-segregates with moderate ID and other symptoms. The frameshift mutation likely leads to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, while the missense mutation affects the mitochondrial localization signal of WARS2.

**Conclusion**: The study identifies two new genes (SARS and WARS2) associated with ARID, highlighting the importance of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in neuronal function and brain development. The findings suggest that disruptions in tRNA-aminoacylation may contribute to the development of cognitive impairments.

**Key words**: aminoacylation, aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase, brain, cognition, intellectual disability, SARS, tRNA, WARS2
