Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "19 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, a nuclear gene encoding for mitochondrial triptophanyl-tRNA synthetase."

INFERRED: The text mentions that 9 individuals were previously reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, but the current study presents an additional case. It is likely that this additional case brings the total number of probands tested to at least 19.

2. Number of variants detected in WARS2:
EXPLICIT: "The trio exomic sequencing from leucocyte-derived DNA was performed after written informed consent as reported earlier. No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected in the mitochondrial DNA. Based on the suspected autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, we prioritized genes carrying biallelic variants in the index and detected 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_201263.2)."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on the total number of variants detected in WARS2 across all probands tested.

3. Number of patients with a clinical phenotype consisting of a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits:
EXPLICIT: "This case broadens the differential diagnostic approach to juvenile hyperkinetic movement disorders with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on the total number of patients with this specific clinical phenotype. However, it mentions that the majority of published patients were reported to have had epileptic seizures, which may suggest a smaller subset of patients with this specific presentation.

4. Number of years the patient survived:
EXPLICIT: "Because the majority of published patients were reported to have had epileptic seizures, the absence of this clinical finding might explain the survival beyond 25 years in our patient."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on the total number of years any patient with WARS2-related mitochondrial disease has survived. However, it mentions that the current patient survived beyond 25 years, which is unusually long for a patient with this condition.

EXPLICIT: "19 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, a nuclear gene encoding for mitochondrial triptophanyl-tRNA synthetase."

INFERRED: The text mentions that 9 individuals were previously reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, but the current study presents an additional case. It is likely that this additional case brings the total number of probands tested to at least 19.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "The trio exomic sequencing from leucocyte-derived DNA was performed after written informed consent as reported earlier. No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected in the mitochondrial DNA."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on the number of heterozygous (HET) probands specifically.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "This case broadens the differential diagnostic approach to juvenile hyperkinetic movement disorders with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

INFERRED: The text mentions that the majority of published patients were reported to have had epileptic seizures, which may suggest a smaller subset of patients with this specific presentation.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Because the majority of published patients were reported to have had epileptic seizures, the absence of this clinical finding might explain the survival beyond 25 years in our patient."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on the total number of compound or double heterozygotes. However, it mentions that the current patient survived beyond 25 years, which is unusually long for a patient with this condition.

Note: There is no explicit mention of the number of positive HET probands in the provided text.
