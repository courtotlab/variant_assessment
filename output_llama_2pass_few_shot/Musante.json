    "text": "The article reports on the identification of mutations in two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) that are associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID). The study was conducted on two Iranian families affected by ARID. The authors used homozygosity mapping, next-generation sequencing, and Sanger sequencing to identify mutations in the SARS (Seryl-tRNA synthetase) and WARS2 (WARS2 tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase) genes.",
