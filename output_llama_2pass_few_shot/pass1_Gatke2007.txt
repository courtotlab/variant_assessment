## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided text:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Three novel mutations were identified: BCHE*FS126, BCHE*328D and BCHE*I3E4-14C."

INFERRED: The text mentions that DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives, suggesting that there may be additional individuals involved in the study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on whether any of the other individuals involved in the study are heterozygous for atypical variants.

3. Number of families:
EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on whether there are any additional families involved in the study beyond the three mentioned.

4. Total number of individuals involved:
EXPLICIT: "Four different inhibitors of the BChE activity were used for determining the phenotypes..."

INFERRED: The text mentions that DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives, suggesting that there may be additional individuals involved in the study beyond those mentioned.

Note that the text does not provide a clear answer to the question of how many individuals are involved in the study, as it only provides information on the three families and the biochemical characteristics of the individuals involved.

## Pages 3-4 ##
Here is the revised version with the answers:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Three novel mutations were identified: BCHE*FS126, BCHE*328D and BCHE*I3E4-14C."

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: The text does not provide information on the number of heterozygous individuals.

3. Number of families:
EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..."

4. Total number of individuals involved:
EXPLICIT: The text does not provide a clear answer, but it mentions that DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives.

Note that the text provides information on the three families mentioned in the study, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of all individuals involved.

Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided text:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Three novel mutations were identified: BCHE*FS126, BCHE*328D and BCHE*I3E4-14C."

INFERRED: The text mentions that DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives, suggesting that there may be additional individuals involved in the study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on whether any of the other individuals involved in the study are heterozygous for atypical variants.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

INFERRED: The text does not provide information on other phenotypes associated with the probands.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

Note that there is only one explicit mention of a compound heterozygote, but it is possible that other individuals may also be compound or double heterozygous based on the text.
