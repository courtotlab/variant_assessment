    "positive_phenotypes": "The text mentions that the patient's clinical presentation is similar to other reported cases of WARS2-related disorders, which include developmental delay, infantile-onset leukoencephalopathy, spasticity, hypotonia, tremor, muscle atrophy, and seizures. The patient has compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "While the text does not provide an explicit count, it mentions that the patient has pathogenic WARS2 mutations and that there are other reported cases of WARS2-related disorders with similar clinical presentations. This suggests that there may be multiple compound/double heterozygotes in the study, but without further information, we cannot confirm this."
