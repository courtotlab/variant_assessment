1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "As the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established with certainty using conventional biochemical tests, DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."

INFERRED: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly mention any proband being heterozygous for a pathogenic variant. The proband in family 1 is described with two different mutations, but it is not explicitly stated that these are on separate alleles (heterozygous). The proband in family 3 is described as compound heterozygous. The proband in family 2 was not sequenced.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

INFERRED: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: Only one proband (family 3) is explicitly described as compound heterozygous. No other probands are described with this specific genetic configuration.

INFERRED: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine..."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3)."

INFERRED: The proband in family 1 is described with two different mutations, but it is not explicitly stated that these are on separate alleles (heterozygous). The proband in family 3 is described as compound heterozygous. The proband in family 2 was not sequenced.
