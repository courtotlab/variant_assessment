## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "This article presents the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a normal dose of mivacurium in a patient with phenotype SS..."

INFERRED: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man..." suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not mention any probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) scheduled for correction of the inner nose."

INFERRED: The text describes the patient as having "phenotype SS" and experiencing "an extensively prolonged duration of action" in response to mivacurium, which implies a phenotype related to prolonged neuromuscular block.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene." 

This indicates there is 1 compound heterozygote.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Retrospectively, the patient gave written informed consent to publish the results and permission to ask his family to participate in a pedigree analysis."

INFERRED: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man..." suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation."

INFERRED: The text does not mention any probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, only family members.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The patientâ€™s BChE activity was zero, indicating that he was homozygous for silent mutations."

INFERRED: The text describes the patient as having "phenotype SS" and experiencing "an extensively prolonged duration of action" in response to mivacurium, which implies a phenotype related to prolonged neuromuscular block.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations."

This indicates there is 1 compound heterozygote.
