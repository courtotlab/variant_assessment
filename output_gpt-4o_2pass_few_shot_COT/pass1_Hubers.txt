1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2 and a clinical phenotype consisting of a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits."

INFERRED: "A 31-year-old man was referred to our movement disorders outpatient clinic at the age of 30 years." (This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.)

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. (The text describes a proband with biallelic variants, not a heterozygous variant.)

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

INFERRED: "cognitive deficits," "ballistic movements and a stepwise loss of already acquired skills," "gross cerebellar atrophy," "developmental cognitive delay and complex movement disorders."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2..."

INFERRED: "The paternally inherited missense variant c.37T>G, p.(Trp13Gly)... The maternally inherited c.149G>A, p.Gly50Asp missense variant..." (This indicates the presence of compound heterozygous mutations in the proband.)
