1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on mutations in two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that are associated with ID in two unrelated Iranian families."

INFERRED: "The probands were examined by experienced clinical geneticists who assessed their physical and mental status." (This suggests at least one proband per family, implying two probands in total.)

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. (The text does not mention any probands who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.)

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In the first family, homozygosity mapping in combination with subsequent mutation screening revealed a homozygous missense mutation in the Seryl-tRNA Synthetase (SARS) gene (MIM# 607529), which co-segregates with moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene, comprising a nonsense mutation (c.325delA, p.Ser109Alafs*15), which very likely entails nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and a missense mutation (c.37T>G, p.Trp13Gly)." 

INFERRED: The description of "compound heterozygous genotype" in the second family implies there is one compound heterozygote.
