## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "In the first family, we identified a homozygous missense mutation..."
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype..."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "In the first family, we identified a homozygous missense mutation..."
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype..."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior"
EXPLICIT: "moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype..."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Family 2 was part of a large study of the molecular basis of ARID and genotyping results of six DNA samples (IV:2, IV:3, V:2, V:7, V:8, V:9) from this family were used for homozygosity mapping..."

INFERRED: Mention of "six DNA samples" from Family 2 suggests multiple probands were tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: Not mentioned in the provided text.

INFERRED: The text mentions homozygosity mapping and sequencing in Family 2, but does not specify the number of positive HET probands.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: Not mentioned in the provided text.

INFERRED: The clinical features listed in the table include ataxia, muscle weakness, seizures, behavior problems (aggressive behavior, temper tantrums), speech impairment, and intellectual disability (ranging from moderate IQ 40-46). These phenotypes are associated with the probands being studied.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "We identified three homozygous genomic intervals with LOD scores above 2... Subsequently, the three homozygous regions were enriched and next-generation sequencing was performed but upon filtering no homozygous apparently disease-causing mutation could be identified."

INFERRED: The text mentions the identification of homozygous genomic intervals but does not provide a clear number of compound/double heterozygotes.
