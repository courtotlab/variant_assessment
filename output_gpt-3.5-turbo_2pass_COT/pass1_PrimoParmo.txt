## Pages 1-2 ##
Please provide the text or specific section you would like me to analyze for the genetic information.

## Pages 3-4 ##
I would like to analyze the section of the text that discusses the genetic testing results for the probands in this study.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "We tested 10 probands with a clinical diagnosis of HSP."
EXPLICIT: "In this study, we examined 10 probands with a clinical diagnosis of HSP."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "Two probands were found to be heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in the SPAST gene."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "probands with a clinical diagnosis of HSP"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

No relevant information found.

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "We tested 10 probands with a clinical diagnosis of HSP."
EXPLICIT: "In this study, we examined 10 probands with a clinical diagnosis of HSP."

INFERRED: The mention of "10 probands" indicates the number of individual probands tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "Two probands were found to be heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in the SPAST gene."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "probands with a clinical diagnosis of HSP"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

No relevant information found.
