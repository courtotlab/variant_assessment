## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine at a time, when it was not possible to perform genotyping."
EXPLICIT: "DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."
EXPLICIT: "In the meantime, some members had died and genotyping was not possible."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: The phenotypes mentioned for the positive HET probands are:
- Family 1: "SS" (homozygous for silent variants)
- Family 3: "*142M/*328D"
- Family 2: "AS" (heterozygous for the atypical variant and a silent variant)

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
