1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man"
EXPLICIT: "A blood sample was drawn at the time of arrival in the intensive care unit to determine the BChE activity, phenotype, and genotype."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "Complete nucleotide sequencing revealed two point mutations, the known silent variant S7 and a previously undescribed mutation of amino acid residue 170 introducing a stop codon."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Complete nucleotide sequencing revealed two point mutations, the known silent variant S7 and a previously undescribed mutation of amino acid residue 170 introducing a stop codon."
