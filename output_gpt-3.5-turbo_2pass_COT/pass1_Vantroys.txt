## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a 6-year-old girl..."
EXPLICIT: "we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability"
EXPLICIT: "the subject reported here was first diagnosed as having cerebral palsy."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: No information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability"
EXPLICIT: "severe delay of early cognitive and motor development"
EXPLICIT: "mild dysmorphic facial features"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: No information found.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents."

INFERRED: Mention of "the proband" suggests a single individual was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: No information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability"
EXPLICIT: "severe delay of early cognitive and motor development"
EXPLICIT: "mild dysmorphic facial features"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Single person Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed and variants were filtered using a mitochondrial gene panel based on the Human MitoCarta2.0 dataset. This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene."

INFERRED: The study identified a single proband with compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene.
