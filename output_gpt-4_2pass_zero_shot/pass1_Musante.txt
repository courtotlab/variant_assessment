## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The text mentions "two Iranian families affected by ARID" and "The probands were examined by experienced clinical geneticists who assessed their physical and mental status." This suggests that at least one proband was tested from each family, implying a minimum of two probands tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In the first family... the variant co-segregates with moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior." 

EXPLICIT: "In the second family... both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene." This suggests that there is at least one compound/double heterozygote in the second family.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: No explicit quote found.

INFERRED: The text mentions "Family 2 was part of a large study of the molecular basis of ARID and genotyping results of six DNA samples (IV:2, IV:3, V:2, V:7, V:8, V:9) from this family were used for homozygosity mapping and multipoint parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis." This suggests that six individuals from Family 2 were tested. Combined with the previous inference of at least two probands tested, this suggests a minimum of eight probands tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: No explicit quote found.

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: The table provides explicit phenotypes for six individuals across two families. These include "Delayed psychomotor development", "Ataxia", "Muscle weakness", "Seizure", "Behavior problems", "Speech impairment", and "Intellectual disability".

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: No explicit quote found.

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The text mentions "DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of the patients, two healthy siblings and their parents, using standard procedures." This suggests that multiple patients were tested, but it does not specify the exact number of probands.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

No relevant information found.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the exonic regions of all 133 genes included in the interval, only two homozygous missense variants co-segregating with the disease in the family 1 were detected in the linkage interval on chromosome 1." This suggests that there are two individuals with homozygous missense variants in family 1, which could imply that these individuals are compound/double heterozygotes. However, this is not explicitly stated.
