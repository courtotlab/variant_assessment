    "num_tested_probands": "The text mentions \"two Iranian families affected by ARID\" and \"The probands were examined by experienced clinical geneticists who assessed their physical and mental status.\" This suggests that at least one proband was tested from each family, implying a minimum of two probands tested. Additionally, \"Family 2 was part of a large study of the molecular basis of ARID and genotyping results of six DNA samples (IV:2, IV:3, V:2, V:7, V:8, V:9) from this family were used for homozygosity mapping and multipoint parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis.\" This suggests that six individuals from Family 2 were tested. Combined with the previous inference of at least two probands tested, this suggests a minimum of eight probands tested.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "\"In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior.\"",
    "positive_phenotypes": "\"In the first family... the variant co-segregates with moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior.\" \n\n\"In the second family... both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior.\"\n\nThe table provides explicit phenotypes for six individuals across two families. These include \"Delayed psychomotor development\", \"Ataxia\", \"Muscle weakness\", \"Seizure\", \"Behavior problems\", \"Speech impairment\", and \"Intellectual disability\".\n\n\"In this report, we describe putatively ID causing mutations in SARS and WARS2 in families with closely overlapping additional clinical features including moderate ID, speech impairment, seizures, ataxia, and muscular weakness.\"",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "\"In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene.\" This suggests that there is at least one compound/double heterozygote in the second family.\n\n\"In the exonic regions of all 133 genes included in the interval, only two homozygous missense variants co-segregating with the disease in the family 1 were detected in the linkage interval on chromosome 1.\" This suggests that there are two individuals with homozygous missense variants in family 1, which could imply that these individuals are compound/double heterozygotes. However, this is not explicitly stated.\n\n\"As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the WARS2 gene in the affected individuals of family 2.\" This confirms the presence of at least one compound/double heterozygote in family 2.\n\n\"In the second family, whole genome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous genotype in affected individuals, consisting of a deleterious frame-shift mutation and a missense change (p.Trp13Gly) in the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase encoding WARS2.\" This confirms the presence of at least one compound/double heterozygote in the second family.",
