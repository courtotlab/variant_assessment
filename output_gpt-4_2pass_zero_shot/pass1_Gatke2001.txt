## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man"

INFERRED: The text refers to "the patient" throughout, suggesting that only one proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "This article presents the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a normal dose of mivacurium in a patient with phenotype SS"

INFERRED: The patient's phenotype is described as SS, which is associated with "extensively prolonged durations of action" in response to mivacurium.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: No new explicit quotes found.

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation."

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The patientâ€™s BChE activity was zero, indicating that he was homozygous for silent mutations."

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Thus, the patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations."

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

EXPLICIT: No new explicit quotes found.

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The homozygous silent phenotype of BChE is characterized by complete absence of BChE activity or by less than 10% activity of the usual phenotype."

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Biochemical data supported the conclusion that the patient was compound heterozygous for two silent mutations."

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.
