    "num_tested_probands": "The text refers to 'the patient' throughout, suggesting that only one proband was tested in this study.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "The patient's phenotype is described as SS, which is associated with 'extensively prolonged durations of action' in response to mivacurium. The patient\u2019s BChE activity was zero, indicating that he was homozygous for silent mutations. The homozygous silent phenotype of BChE is characterized by complete absence of BChE activity or by less than 10% activity of the usual phenotype.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene. Thus, the patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations. Biochemical data supported the conclusion that the patient was compound heterozygous for two silent mutations.",
    "explanation": "The information was extracted from the provided genetic case report."
