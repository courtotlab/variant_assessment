    "num_tested_probands": "As the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established with certainty using conventional biochemical tests, DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "Hereditary low BChE activity may result in an extensively prolonged duration of action of these drugs, especially in patients who are homozygous for the atypical or silent variants.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M.",
