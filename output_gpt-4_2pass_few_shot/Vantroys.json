Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intra-uterine growth retardation... When examined at the age of eleven months, severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs were noticed and she was found to have slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum... When seen at eighteen months of age, a severe delay of cognitive and motor development was confirmed.\" and \"The proposita had presented at young age with developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability. Her condition remained stable for several years until she presented for the first time with seizures at the age of six years and a treatment with sodium valproate was initiated. During the next month, her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and ultimately she developed acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy.\"",

The first variant (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10) was a single nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift and premature stopcodon. The second variant (c.938 A > T, p.Lys313Met) was a missense variant.\"",
