## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man"

INFERRED: The text refers to "the patient" in singular form, suggesting that only one proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

INFERRED: The patient is described as healthy, but with a response to mivacurium that was an "extensively prolonged duration of action." This suggests a phenotype related to abnormal response to mivacurium.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: No new explicit information found.

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation."

INFERRED: The text suggests that the father, mother, and one brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation, but it is not clear if they are probands in this study.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: No new explicit information found.

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Thus, the patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations."

INFERRED: "One brother has the same genotype as the patient," suggests that there is another individual who is compound heterozygous. However, it is not clear if this brother was a proband in the study.
