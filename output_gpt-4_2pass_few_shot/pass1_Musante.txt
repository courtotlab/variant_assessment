## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The text does not provide an explicit number of probands tested. However, it mentions "two Iranian families affected by ARID" and "the probands were examined by experienced clinical geneticists who assessed their physical and mental status." This suggests that at least one proband from each family was tested, implying a minimum of two probands.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: No explicit information found.

INFERRED: The text mentions "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene." This suggests that at least one proband from the second family had a heterozygous mutation. However, the exact number of heterozygous probands is not specified.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "we have identified mutations in two different ARS genes. In the first family, homozygosity mapping in combination with subsequent mutation screening revealed a homozygous missense mutation in the Seryl-tRNA Synthetase (SARS) gene (MIM# 607529), which co-segregates with moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."

INFERRED: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene."

INFERRED: The text does not specify the exact number of individuals with compound heterozygous mutations. However, it mentions that these mutations were found in the second family, suggesting at least one individual is a compound heterozygote.

EXPLICIT: No explicit information found.

INFERRED: The text does not provide clear information on the number of probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: No explicit information found.

INFERRED: The table provides a list of clinical features for each individual, including gender, parental consanguinity, ethnic origin, birth, growth parameters, age at latest examination, weight, height, OFC, facial features, psychomotor development, ataxia, muscle weakness, seizure, behavior problems, speech impairment, intellectual disability, and other anomalies. These could be considered as the phenotypes associated with the probands.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: No explicit information found.

INFERRED: The text mentions "Family 2-V:7" and "Family 2-V:8" with "WARS2 (NM_201263.2; NP_957715.1) mutations c.325delA (p.Ser109Alafs*159) c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly)". This suggests that at least two individuals are compound heterozygotes.
