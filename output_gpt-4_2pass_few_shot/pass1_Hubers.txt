1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: No explicit quote found.

INFERRED: "Here, we further increase the knowledge on the clinical presentation of WARS2 deficiency by presenting the first case with a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism." This suggests that one proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: No explicit quote found.

INFERRED: "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2 and a clinical phenotype consisting of a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits." This suggests that the proband was not heterozygous but had biallelic variants, implying two mutated alleles.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2 and a clinical phenotype consisting of a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits." The proband's phenotype includes a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: No explicit quote found.

INFERRED: "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2 and a clinical phenotype consisting of a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits." This suggests that the proband had two mutated alleles, implying a compound or double heterozygote.

INFERRED: "Clinical presentation of the 31-year-old patient in the movement disorders outpatient clinic in 2018 showing a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable dystonic and ballistic movements. He can communicate nonverbally with the parents on a basic level and react to orders." This suggests that the proband's phenotype includes a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable dystonic and ballistic movements, and the ability to communicate nonverbally on a basic level and react to orders.
