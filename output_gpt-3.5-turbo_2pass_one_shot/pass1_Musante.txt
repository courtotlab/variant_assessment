INFERRED: Mention of "two unrelated Iranian families" suggests two probands were tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene, comprising a nonsense mutation (c.325delA, p.Ser109Alafs*15) and a missense mutation (c.37T>G, p.Trp13Gly)."

INFERRED: The second family had compound heterozygous mutations, indicating 1 positive HET proband.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior"
EXPLICIT: "moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene, comprising a nonsense mutation (c.325delA, p.Ser109Alafs*15) and a missense mutation (c.37T>G, p.Trp13Gly)."

Since only one instance of compound heterozygous mutations is mentioned, it can be inferred that there is 1 compound heterozygote in this study.
