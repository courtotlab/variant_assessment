## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine...DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."
EXPLICIT: "Genotypes were determined using complete nucleotide sequencing."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
EXPLICIT: "the proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126"
EXPLICIT: "whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
