1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "we report the case of a 17-year-old boy"
EXPLICIT: "Here, we describe a patient with pathogenic WARS2 mutations"

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years"
EXPLICIT: "This case expands the phenotypic spectrum of WARS2 deficiency and emphasizes the importance of mitochondrial protein synthesis in the pathogenesis of Parkinsonism"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp)"
