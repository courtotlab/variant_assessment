## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "This is the first report of severe hepatopathy in a subject with WARS2 deficiency."

INFERRED: Mention of "the patient" and "this case" suggesting a single proband.

No relevant information found regarding the number of unique individuals explicitly mentioned as having undergone genetic testing.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that the subject was considered to have a non-progressive encephalopathy, but it does not explicitly state whether she is a heterozygous carrier or not. However, it does mention that "the diagnosis of a mitochondrial defect was made" after sodium valproate treatment.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that the subject had "early developmental delay", "motor weakness", and "intellectual disability". It also mentions that she developed acute liver failure and severe progressive encephalopathy after starting sodium valproate treatment.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly mention the number of compound or double heterozygotes, but it does mention that "two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2" and that the subject had a "mosaic pattern was seen in hepatocytes after cytochrome c oxidase staining". This suggests that the subject may have compound or double heterozygosity, but it is not explicitly stated.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: Mention of "the patient" and "this case" suggesting a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text does not provide explicit information on the number of heterozygous carriers, but it mentions that the subject was diagnosed with WARS2 deficiency after whole exome sequencing and filtering for mitochondrial gene variants.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that the subject had "early developmental delay", "motor weakness", and "intellectual disability". It also mentions that she developed acute liver failure and severe progressive encephalopathy after starting sodium valproate treatment.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly mention the number of compound or double heterozygotes, but it mentions that "two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2" and that the subject had a "mosaic pattern was seen in hepatocytes after cytochrome c oxidase staining". This suggests that the subject may have compound or double heterozygosity, but it is not explicitly stated.

Uncertainty/Ambiguity:
- The text does not provide explicit information on the number of probands tested, which could be inferred from the context as a single individual.
- The text does not explicitly state whether the subject is a heterozygous carrier or not, despite mentioning that "the diagnosis of a mitochondrial defect was made" after sodium valproate treatment.
