Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) scheduled for correction of the inner nose."

INFERRED: The text mentions that the study involved a single individual, but it does not explicitly state the number of individuals tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

This statement implies that the patient is a positive HET proband, as they have two different pathogenic variants (silent mutations) in the same gene.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The patient had been anesthetized previously without any known complications, and low BChE activity was not suspected."

This statement implies that the patient has a normal phenotype, but it does not explicitly state the phenotypes associated with compound heterozygous mutations.

INFERRED: The text mentions that patients who are homozygous for atypical mutations or compound heterozygous for atypical and silent mutations respond to mivacurium with extensively prolonged durations of action. However, it does not provide information on the specific phenotypes associated with these conditions.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

This statement explicitly states that the patient is a compound heterozygote, meaning they have two different pathogenic variants (silent mutations) in the same gene.

Note that there are no explicit statements about double heterozygotes in the text.
