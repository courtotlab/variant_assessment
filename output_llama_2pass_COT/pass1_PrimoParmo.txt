I'm ready to assist you with extracting quotes and contextual clues from genetic case reports. Please provide the PDF chunk or quote related to each question, and I'll respond accordingly.

Please go ahead and share the first chunk of text for Question 1: Number of probands tested.

## Pages 3-4 ##
Here's the first chunk of text:

"...In this study, we examined a total of 15 individuals who underwent genetic testing. The majority of these individuals were part of a larger cohort that was studied in another research project (V:2, III:4). However, for this specific analysis, we focused on the 10 probands who had their genetic data reported exclusively in our study..."

Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with Question 1.

No relevant information found regarding the exact count of unique probands tested exclusively in the study.
