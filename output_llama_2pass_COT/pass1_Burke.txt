## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient, following informed and written consent, under the protocol 76-HG-0238..."

INFERRED: Mention of "the patient" suggests a single individual being studied.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of heterozygous probands, but it mentions that the patient has compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp). This suggests that there may be other individuals with similar mutations, but the exact number is not specified.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism"

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient has a form of autosomal recessive intellectual disability and a syndrome of severe infantile-onset leukoencephalopathy associated with mutations in WARS2. However, it does not explicitly state which phenotype is being studied.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "compound heterozygous for... p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp"

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient has compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2, but it does not specify how many individuals have similar mutations.

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient has compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2, but it does not specify how many individuals have similar mutations.

Note: There is no explicit mention of the number of probands tested or the number of positive HET probands. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that there may be other individuals with similar mutations as the patient, but the exact numbers are not specified.

Uncertainty/Ambiguity:
- The text does not provide a clear answer to the question about the number of probands tested.
- The text mentions that the patient has compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2, but it does not specify how many individuals have similar mutations.
