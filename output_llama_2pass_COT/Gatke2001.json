    "positive_phenotypes": "The text does not explicitly state the phenotypes associated with compound heterozygous mutations, but it mentions that patients who are homozygous for atypical mutations or compound heterozygous for atypical and silent mutations respond to mivacurium with extensively prolonged durations of action.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The patient is a compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene, which means they have two different pathogenic variants (silent mutations) in the same gene. There are no explicit statements about double heterozygotes in the text."
