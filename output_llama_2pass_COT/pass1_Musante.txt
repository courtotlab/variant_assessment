## Pages 1-2 ##
Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The index patient (V:1) was sequenced, and siblings and parents were also sequenced, when available."

INFERRED: Mention of "the patients" in the abstract suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that mutations in at least five mitochondrial ARSs have already been associated with brain-specific phenotypes, but it does not explicitly state how many heterozygous carriers were identified in this study.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior"

INFERRED: The text mentions that the probands have a similar accompanying features (Table 1), but it does not explicitly state what those features are.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that the second family has a "compound DNA-alterations" affecting the WARS2 gene, but it does not provide information on how many individuals have this genotype.

## Pages 7-8 ##
Here are the answers to your questions with the requested labels and explanations:

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that "the index patient (V:1) was sequenced, and siblings and parents were also sequenced, when available." This suggests that there is at least one proband, but it does not provide information on the total number of individuals tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that "mutations in at least five mitochondrial ARSs have already been associated with brain-specific phenotypes" but does not explicitly state how many heterozygous carriers were identified in this study.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that the probands have a similar accompanying features (Table 1), but it does not explicitly state what those features are.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that "the second family has a 'compound DNA-alterations' affecting the WARS2 gene" but does not provide information on how many individuals have this genotype.

Note: There is no explicit mention of the number of probands tested in the provided text.

## Pages 13-14 ##
I can't help with extracting quotes from a document that has not been provided. Can I assist you with something else?

## Pages 15-16 ##
It seems like there was an error in my previous response. The text you provided does not have any explicit quotes or questions to extract answers from.

If you could provide the actual text, I would be happy to help you extract quotes and answer your questions. Alternatively, if you have a specific question or topic related to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases or genetic disorders, I'd be happy to try and assist you with that.
