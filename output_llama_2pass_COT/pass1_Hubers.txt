Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "19 different mitochondrial tRNA synthetases exist and are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis."

INFERRED: The text mentions that 9 individuals were reported with biallelic variants in WARS2, but it does not explicitly state the number of unique probands tested. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the study included at least these 9 individuals.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that "the patient received symptomatic treatment with tiapridhydro-chloride up to 450 mg per day, which reduced the occurrence and the amplitude of the hyperkinetic movements" but does not explicitly state that the patient was a heterozygote. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the study included at least one individual who was a heterozygote.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements."

INFERRED: The text mentions that the patient had "cognitive deﬁcits" but does not explicitly state what specific cognitive deficits were present. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the study included at least one individual who had a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: None

INFERRED: The text mentions that "No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected in the mitochondrial DNA" but does not explicitly state the number of individuals with compound or double heterozygous mutations. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the study included at least one individual who was a compound heterozygote.

Note: The text does mention that "the majority of published patients were reported to have had epileptic seizures" but this information is not relevant to answering the question about the number of compound/double heterozygotes.
