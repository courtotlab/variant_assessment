## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine at a time, when it was not possible to perform genotyping."
EXPLICIT: "DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."
EXPLICIT: "Genotypes were determined using complete nucleotide sequencing."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The probands of the three unrelated families were referred to DCRU because of prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."
EXPLICIT: "two of the patients were homozygous for a silent variant and one was heterozygous for the atypical and a silent variant (AS)."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
