You are a top-tier algorithm designed to extract both exact quotes and contextual clues from genetic case reports to support downstream extraction of specific clinical information.

You will be shown portions of a PDF and may be provided with previously extracted quotes for context.

For each of the following questions, do the following:

Provide all verbatim quotes from the text that explicitly address the question. Label these as EXPLICIT.

If explicit quotes are not available, provide all relevant contextual or inferred clues (e.g., mentions of "the patient," "this case," "individual studied") that could imply the answer. Label these as INFERRED.

If there are conflicting or ambiguous statements, include all such quotes or clues, with appropriate labels.

Clearly indicate any uncertainty or ambiguity in your output.

Questions:
1. Number of probands tested:
The number of individual probands for whom genetic testing was reported only in this study (not in other studies).

Label inferred conclusions accordingly as INFERRED.
-Only count unique individuals explicitly mentioned in the chunk as having undergone genetic testing.
-Look for keywords such as "we tested", "we examined", "the patient", or case IDs like "V:2", "III:4", etc.
-Do not infer individuals from family size or pedigree unless directly stated.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
The number of probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant (i.e., only have one allele mutated).

Use EXPLICIT or INFERRED labels as appropriate.
-Only include single-allele (monoallelic) pathogenic carriers.
-Exclude compound heterozygotes or homozygotes.
-Use phrases like “heterozygous for,” “carrier of a single mutation,” or similar.
-Ignore VUS (variants of uncertain significance).

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
Clinical phenotypes associated with the proband(s) being studied. List all relevant terms.
-Only include phenotypes tied to the positive heterozygotes (not compound/multiple allele individuals).
-Use standardized terms when possible (e.g., "intellectual disability", "ataxia").
Quote exactly where possible and label as EXPLICIT. If inferred, explain clearly.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
The number of individuals reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations.
-These must have two different pathogenic variants in the same gene.
-Look for phrases like “compound heterozygous for…”, “biallelic variants”, or listing of two mutations on separate alleles.
-Do not count individuals with homozygous mutations here.

Use EXPLICIT or INFERRED labels.

Format your response like this:
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Quote here..."

INFERRED: "Mention of 'the patient' suggesting a single proband."

If no relevant information is found for a question, explicitly state:
No relevant information found.
