You are a top-tier algorithm designed to extract specific clinical information from genetic case reports. The extracted information must be  
returned in **JSON format**. You must look in the report for the following fields:
---

### Fields to Extract:

1. Number of probands tested: The number of individual probands for whom genetic testing was reported only in this study not in other studies.
2. Number of positive HET probands: The number of probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant; only have one allele that is mutated.
3. Positive proband phenotype(s): Clinical phenotypes associated with the proband(s) being studied in this study. List all relevant terms.
4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes: The number of individuals reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations.

## JSON schema
1. "num_tested_probands"/The number of individual probands for whom genetic testing was reported.
2. "num_positive_het_probands"/The number of probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.
3. "positive_phenotypes"/Clinical phenotypes associated with the positive probands. List all relevant terms.
4. "num_compound_or_double_hets"/The number of individuals reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations.
5. "explanation"/A dictionary explaining where each field was found in the report.
