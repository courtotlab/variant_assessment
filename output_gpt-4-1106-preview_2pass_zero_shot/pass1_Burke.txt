## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."
INFERRED: The use of "the case" suggests a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp) who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."
INFERRED: Since the text refers to "a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations," it can be inferred that there is 1 individual with compound heterozygous mutations.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The patient was the first and only child born to non-consanguineous parents of European descent with no relevant family history."
EXPLICIT: "Early development was normal until the age of 1 when he was first noted to have left leg tremor while learning to stand."
EXPLICIT: "At 18 months, the left leg tremor spread to his right leg and he was noted to have expressive language delay despite good receptive language skills."
EXPLICIT: "By 23 months, tremor had also become apparent in the upper extremities along with intermittent dystonic posturing of all extremities."
EXPLICIT: "The patient began to experience typical motor complications of more advanced PD including peak-dose and wearing-off phenomena with disabling retrocollic dystonic spasms."
EXPLICIT: "The patient was evaluated at the NIH at age 9 and had advanced Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism with prominent and unpredictable 'on-off' fluctuations, peak-dose dyskinesia, stooped posture and disabling off-dystonia."
EXPLICIT: "Chronic headaches occurred due to retrocollic dystonic spasms."
EXPLICIT: "A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested progressive generalized brain atrophy."
EXPLICIT: "At age 10, he underwent implantation of deep brain stimulator (DBS) leads that resulted in substantial improvement in the motor complications of PD."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Specifically, the patient was compound heterozygous for 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_015836.3): a missense variant c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly) that was inherited from his mother and a missense variant c.683C>G (p.Ser228Trp) that was inherited from his father."
INFERRED: Since the text refers to "the patient was compound heterozygous for 2 variants in WARS2," it can be inferred that there is 1 individual with compound heterozygous mutations.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."
INFERRED: The use of "a fourth patient" suggests that this study is reporting on a single new proband in addition to previously reported cases.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 and a clinical presentation of infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism."
INFERRED: The patient's clinical presentation is described as "infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism," which implies the phenotype associated with the proband.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."
INFERRED: Since the text refers to "a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations," it can be inferred that there is 1 individual with compound heterozygous mutations in this study.
