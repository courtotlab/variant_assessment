## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."

INFERRED: The text suggests that there were at least two probands from whom DNA samples were collected for this study, as indicated by "two of the probands."

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of heterozygous probands, but it does mention that "a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126." This implies that there is at least one heterozygous individual related to the probands, but it is not clear if this relative is considered a proband themselves.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M. In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

INFERRED: The phenotypes associated with the probands include "severely prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine" and "BChE activity was below detection limit."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: Since only one individual is described as "compound heterozygous," we can infer that there is at least one compound/double heterozygote reported in this study.

1. Number of probands tested:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126"
EXPLICIT: "The proband (2-1) was not sequenced, but had previously been ascribed a phenotype as compound heterozygous for the atypical variant and a silent variant using biochemical assays."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M"

INFERRED: The text suggests that there were at least three probands tested in this study, one from each family mentioned (family 1, family 2, and family 3).

2. Number of positive HET probands:
EXPLICIT: "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3)."

INFERRED: The text explicitly mentions one patient (patient 2–3) who is heterozygous for BCHE*FS126. There is no explicit mention of other heterozygous probands, so we can infer that there is at least one positive HET proband reported in this study.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126 and displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine resulting in 3 hours of apnoea and hence postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit."
EXPLICIT: "This patient experienced prolonged duration of action of 360 min following succinylcholine."
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M, the latter mutation also known as the H-variant. BChE activity was below detection limit, and the patient had experienced a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine of 90 min, which is six times the normal duration."

INFERRED: The phenotypes associated with the probands include prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine, apnoea requiring postoperative artificial ventilation, and BChE activity below detection limit.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: Since only one individual is described as "compound heterozygous," we can infer that there is at least one compound/double heterozygote reported in this study.
