    "positive_phenotypes": "EXPLICIT: Clinical phenotypes such as 'a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements', 'cognitive deficits', 'developmental cognitive delay and complex movement disorders', and 'juvenile hyperkinetic movement disorders with dystonia, chorea, and ballism' are mentioned.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "INFERRED: The patient described has biallelic variants in WARS2, which suggests that the patient is a compound heterozygote, as indicated by the inheritance of different variants from each parent."
