## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "Here, we present a 6-year-old girl..." suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability and who was considered during several years as having a non-progressive encephalopathy."

INFERRED: The proband developed "acute liver failure and severe progressive encephalopathy" after treatment with sodium valproate, which suggests these phenotypes are associated with the proband's condition.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)."

INFERRED: The presence of two pathogenic variants in WARS2 in the proband suggests that she is a compound heterozygote, implying there is 1 compound heterozygote.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "The same fractions were prepared from liver from the proband and controls." This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: "As the great majority of mitochondrial diseases follows a recessive mode of inheritance (after exclusion of mtDNA alterations), only variants that were homozygous or compound heterozygous were included." This implies that the study was looking for homozygous or compound heterozygous variants, but does not explicitly state that the proband was heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents. Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intrauterine growth retardation. Birth weight was 2314 g, length 45 cm and head circumference 31.8 cm. The neonatal period was without complications. When examined at the age of eleven months, severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs were noticed and she was found to have slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum."

EXPLICIT: "When seen at eighteen months of age, a severe delay of cognitive and motor development was confirmed. The cognitive development was estimated at less than six months. She had no head control and rigidity of arms and legs was noticed. Fists were bilaterally clenched."

EXPLICIT: "At six years of age, she was hospitalized because of a long lasting episode with decreased awareness, lateral eye deviation and twitching of the eyelids at the left."

EXPLICIT: "One month later, she was taken to a local hospital after she was found stuporous at home in the morning. Dystonic posturing of the limbs together with motor hyperactivity and continuous choreatic movements were seen."

EXPLICIT: "She was diagnosed with acute liver failure (ALF) and metabolic encephalopathy."

EXPLICIT: "Ophthalmological examination revealed optic atrophy."

EXPLICIT: "Cerebral MRI showed enlargement of the lateral ventricles and third ventricle presumably due to white matter loss. Subarachnoidal spaces were abnormally large, most marked in the frontal regions bilaterally. In the posterior fossa, the vermis cerebelli was hypoplastic, the fourth ventricle was enlarged and the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles were hypoplastic."

EXPLICIT: "When seen ambulatory at the child neurology department, she was stuporous with ptosis of the eyelids bilaterally and severe generalized amyotrophy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836)."

INFERRED: The statement about the two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene implies that the proband is a compound heterozygote, which would mean there is 1 compound heterozygote.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "Here, we report on a 6-year-old child with WARS2 deficiency." This suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity." This implies that the proband is compound heterozygous, not simply heterozygous for a single pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proposita had presented at young age with developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability."

EXPLICIT: "Her condition remained stable for several years until she presented for the first time with seizures at the age of six years and a treatment with sodium valproate was initiated."

EXPLICIT: "During the next month, her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and ultimately she developed acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy."

EXPLICIT: "Sodium valproate was stopped but nevertheless she became progressively more unconscious and died half a year later."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity."

INFERRED: The use of a primer pair to confirm compound heterozygosity and the mention of two variants being on different alleles suggest that there is 1 compound heterozygote.

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "The presence of a subcomplex of complex V in our subject was therefore suggestive of an intramitochondrial protein synthesis defect." This suggests a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In the subject reported here, microscopic examination of liver showed a mosaic pattern after activity staining of cytochrome c oxidase."

EXPLICIT: "A defect in a nuclear encoded gene was suspected in the proposita as a combined defect of OXPHOS complexes involving the complexes I, III and IV was seen in liver, together with the presence of a subcomplex of complex V and the normal entire mtDNA sequencing."

EXPLICIT: "A wide variety of brain MRI abnormalities were found in the WARS2 deficient subjects."

EXPLICIT: "Cerebral MRI in the proband also showed atrophy most prominent in the frontal regions and, in addition, atrophy of the vermis cerebelli, brainstem and cerebellar peduncles."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The identical compound heterozygous mutant genotype (p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ p.Lys313Met) was found in the two subjects with severe neonatal expression reported by Wortmann et al. (Table 2)."

INFERRED: The mention of "the identical compound heterozygous mutant genotype" in the context of the proband suggests that the proband is a compound heterozygote, which would mean there is 1 compound heterozygote.
