## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: The text discusses "the probands" in the context of two Iranian families, suggesting at least two probands were tested. However, the exact number is not explicitly stated.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "In the first family... co-segregates with moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."
EXPLICIT: "In the second family... co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene."
INFERRED: Since the text mentions "compound DNA-alterations" in the context of the second family, it can be inferred that there is at least one individual with compound heterozygous mutations.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: The table lists six individuals from two families with specific mutations, suggesting that at least these six individuals were tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
INFERRED: The table does not explicitly state the zygosity of the mutations for the individuals listed. However, since Family 2 individuals (V:7 and V:8) have two different mutations listed (c.325delA and c.37T>G in WARS2), it can be inferred that these individuals might be compound heterozygotes rather than simple heterozygotes.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "Delayed psychomotor development, Ataxia, Muscle weakness, Seizure, Behavior problems, Speech impairment, Intellectual disability"
INFERRED: The table lists clinical features for six individuals, which can be inferred to be the phenotypes associated with the probands being studied.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: The table lists two individuals from Family 2 (V:7 and V:8) with two different mutations in the WARS2 gene, which suggests that these individuals are compound heterozygotes. Therefore, it can be inferred that there are at least two compound/double heterozygotes.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: The text discusses "the patients" in the context of two Iranian families, with multiple children affected in each family, suggesting that multiple probands were tested. However, the exact number is not explicitly stated.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "All affected children were born at full term after uneventful pregnancies, followed by a normal neonatal period. Testing of cognitive function using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) showed an intelligence quotient (IQ) 40–45 in the range of moderate ID, speech impairment (slow and slurred speech) and aggressive behavior. In addition, the patients presented with microcephaly, ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years), and muscular weakness (since the age of 6–10). All patients developed tonic–clonic seizures during infancy, which are well controlled by sodium valproate."
EXPLICIT: "Two affected siblings (V:7 and V:8) presented with moderate ID (IQ = 41–46), athetosis, aggressive behavior, and speech impairment (slow and slurred speech). Moreover muscular weakness and ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years) were observed."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of compound/double heterozygotes, but given the context of the clinical reports of families 1 and 2, it can be inferred that there are multiple individuals with compound heterozygous mutations. However, the exact number is not provided in the quoted text.

However, the exact number is not provided in the quoted text.

## Pages 9-10 ##
1. Number of probands tested:
INFERRED: The text does not provide an explicit number of probands tested in this specific section. However, previous extractions suggest multiple probands from two Iranian families were tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
No relevant information found in this specific section. Previously extracted quotes from other sections provide explicit phenotypes.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the WARS2 gene in the affected individuals of family 2."
INFERRED: This statement implies that there is at least one individual with a compound heterozygous mutation in family 2.

## Pages 11-12 ##

INFERRED: The text does not provide an explicit number of probands tested in this specific section. However, previous extractions suggest multiple probands from two Iranian families were tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
EXPLICIT: "In this report, we describe putatively ID causing mutations in SARS and WARS2 in families with closely overlapping additional clinical features including moderate ID, speech impairment, seizures, ataxia, and muscular weakness."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
EXPLICIT: "In the second family, whole genome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous genotype in affected individuals, consisting of a deleterious frame-shift mutation and a missense change (p.Trp13Gly) in the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase encoding WARS2."
INFERRED: Since the text mentions "affected individuals" in the context of the second family with a compound heterozygous genotype, it can be inferred that there is more than one individual with compound heterozygous mutations. However, the exact number is not explicitly stated.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
INFERRED: "This suggests that Wars2−/L53 represents a compound hypomorph similar to the situation observed in our patients." This implies that the phenotype observed in the animal model may be similar to that observed in the patients, although it does not provide specific clinical details.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
INFERRED: "This suggests that Wars2−/L53 represents a compound hypomorph similar to the situation observed in our patients." This suggests that the patients observed in the study may have a compound heterozygous condition similar to the animal model described, although it does not provide an explicit number of such individuals.
