1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability..."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text mentions "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)." This suggests that the proband may be heterozygous for these pathogenic variants, but it is not explicitly stated.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability..." and "At the age of six years, she had an epileptic seizure which was treated with sodium valproate. In the months after treatment was started, she developed acute liver failure and severe progressive encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

INFERRED: The text mentions "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)." This suggests that the proband may be compound heterozygous for these pathogenic variants, but it is not explicitly stated.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The same fractions were prepared from liver from the proband and controls." 

INFERRED: The text consistently refers to "the proband," suggesting a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No new explicit information found.

INFERRED: The text mentions "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836)." This suggests that the proband may be heterozygous for these pathogenic variants, but it is not explicitly stated.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents. Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intra-uterine growth retardation. Birth weight was 2314 g, length 45 cm and head circumference 31.8 cm. The neonatal period was without complications. When examined at the age of eleven months, severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs were noticed and she was found to have slight dysmorphic features, i.e. a thin upper lip, low set ears, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism of the eyes and an ogival palatum." and "When seen at eighteen months of age, a severe delay of cognitive and motor development was confirmed. The cognitive development was estimated at less than six months. She had no head control and rigidity of arms and legs was noticed. Fists were bilaterally clenched."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836). The first variant (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10) was a single nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift and premature stopcodon. The second variant (c.938 A > T, p.Lys313Met) was a missense variant." This explicitly states that the proband is compound heterozygous for these two variants.

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: No new explicit information found.

INFERRED: The text continues to refer to "the proband," suggesting a single proband was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "Sanger sequencing of DNA from the mother, revealed that she is a carrier of the first variant (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10) and does not carry the missense variant." This suggests that the proband inherited one variant from the mother, supporting the inference that the proband is heterozygous.

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a 6-year-old child with WARS2 deficiency. The proposita had presented at young age with developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability. Her condition remained stable for several years until she presented for the first time with seizures at the age of six years and a treatment with sodium valproate was initiated. During the next month, her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and ultimately she developed acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In the subject reported here, microscopic examination of liver showed a mosaic pattern after activity staining of cytochrome c oxidase. Hepatocytes with strong mitochondrial activity were found adjacent to cells that showed scarce or no reaction product (Fig. 1c-d)." and "In conclusion, we broaden the clinical spectrum of WARS2 deficiency and report for the first time a severe hepatopathy associated with valproate treatment in a subject with WARS2 deficiency."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Two variants were found in WARS2. One was a frameshift mutation (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10), the other a missense mutation (c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)." and "The identical compound heterozygous mutant genotype (p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ p.Lys313Met) was found in the two subjects with severe neonatal expression reported by Wortmann et al. (Table 2)."

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.
