1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "As the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established with certainty using conventional biochemical tests, DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text mentions that "the proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126." This suggests that at least one proband was heterozygous, but it's not clear if this proband was tested or not.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M. In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126... The mutation BCHE*FS126 also occurred in the unrelated family 2 (Table 1). One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3). The proband (2-1) was not sequenced... The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3)."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126 and displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine resulting in 3 hours of apnoea and hence postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit... The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M, the latter mutation also known as the H-variant. BChE activity was below detection limit, and the patient had experienced a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine of 90 min, which is six times the normal duration."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
