  "explanation": {
    "num_tested_probands": "The report states 'Here, we further increase the knowledge on the clinical presentation of WARS2 deficiency by presenting the first case with a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism.' This suggests that only one proband was tested in this study.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "No relevant information found in the report to suggest any probands were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "The report describes the proband's phenotype as follows: 'A 31-year-old man was referred to our movement disorders outpatient clinic at the age of 30 years. He was born at term to healthy parents after an uncomplicated pregnancy; neonatal and early infantile course were unremarkable. A younger sister of 4 years had no medical complaints. At the age of 15 months, the patient had first come to medical attention because of ballistic movements and a stepwise loss of already acquired skills. Since the age of 2 years, the patient showed a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements. He could communicate nonverbally with the parents on a basic level and react to orders.'",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The report states 'Trio exomic sequencing from leucocyte-derived DNA was performed after written informed consent as reported earlier. No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected in the mitochondrial DNA. Based on the suspected autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, we prioritized genes carrying biallelic variants in the index and detected 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_201263.2).' This suggests that the proband is a compound/double heterozygote."
