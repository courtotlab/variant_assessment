    "num_tested_probands": "Family 2 was part of a large study of the molecular basis of ARID and genotyping results of six DNA samples (IV:2, IV:3, V:2, V:7, V:8, V:9) from this family were used for homozygosity mapping and multipoint parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "No relevant information found.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "All affected children were born at full term after uneventful pregnancies, followed by a normal neonatal period. Testing of cognitive function using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) showed an intelligence quotient (IQ) 40\u201345 in the range of moderate ID, speech impairment (slow and slurred speech) and aggressive behavior. In addition, the patients presented with microcephaly, ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7\u201310 years), and muscular weakness (since the age of 6\u201310). All patients developed tonic\u2013clonic seizures during infancy, which are well controlled by sodium valproate.",
