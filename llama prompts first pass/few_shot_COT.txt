You are a top-tier algorithm designed to extract both exact quotes and contextual clues from genetic case reports to support downstream extraction of specific clinical information.

You will be shown portions of a PDF and may be provided with previously extracted quotes for context.

For each of the following questions, do the following:

Provide all verbatim quotes from the text that explicitly address the question. Label these as EXPLICIT.

If explicit quotes are not available, provide all relevant contextual or inferred clues (e.g., mentions of "the patient," "this case," "individual studied") that could imply the answer. Label these as INFERRED.

If there are conflicting or ambiguous statements, include all such quotes or clues, with appropriate labels.

Clearly indicate any uncertainty or ambiguity in your output.

Questions:
1. Number of probands tested:
The number of individual probands for whom genetic testing was reported only in this study (not in other studies).

Label inferred conclusions accordingly as INFERRED.

2. Number of positive HET probands:
The number of probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant (i.e., only have one allele mutated).

Include only heterozygous (not compound or homozygous) cases that are part of this study.

Use EXPLICIT or INFERRED labels as appropriate.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):
Clinical phenotypes associated with the proband(s) being studied. List all relevant terms.

Quote exactly where possible and label as EXPLICIT. If inferred, explain clearly.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:
The number of individuals reported to have compound or double heterozygous mutations.

If the patient is described as “compound heterozygous” or similar, and there are no others, infer this as 1.

Use EXPLICIT or INFERRED labels.

Format your response like this:
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Quote here..."

INFERRED: "Mention of 'the patient' suggesting a single proband."

If no relevant information is found for a question, explicitly state:
No relevant information found.

Example 1:

Input text:
"As the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established with certainty using conventional biochemical tests, DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives. Genotypes were determined using complete nucleotide sequencing... The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126, whereas the proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M... The proband in family 2 was not sequenced..."

Chain-of-thought:
- Three probands are mentioned
- Proband 1 has BCHE115DI3E4-14C on one allele and BCHE*FS126 on the other. The text does not say these are on opposite alleles (in trans), nor does it explicitly label this as a compound heterozygote.
- Proband 3 explicitly described as compound heterozygous for two different pathogenic alleles.
- Proband 2 was not sequenced.
- Only one heterozygous carrier (a relative of proband 2) is mentioned, but that individual is not a proband.
- No mention of phenotypes.

Expected output:
- Number of probands tested: 3  
- Number of positive HET probands: 1  
- Number of compound/double heterozygotes: 1  
- Positive proband phenotype(s):

Example 2:

Input text:
"Mystery solved after 23 years: M syndrome is PIGT-associated multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 3...  
Rauch et al. (1999) reported... two sisters with a new syndrome... Exome sequencing... allowed the identification of two variants in PIGT... It was possible to determine that the variants are in trans... Sanger sequencing was subsequently performed in both sisters, confirming they both harbor the two variants..."

Chain-of-thought:
- Two sisters are the probands → 2 tested probands.
- Both confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
- Each sister has two variants in trans → compound heterozygotes.
- No mention of a single heterozygous pathogenic carrier → 0 positive HETs.
- Phenotype is described in the title: "multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome".

Expected output:
- Number of probands tested: 2  
- Number of positive HET probands: 0  
- Number of compound/double heterozygotes: 2  
- Positive proband phenotype(s): multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome

Example 3:

Input text:
"Analyzing clinical and genetic characteristics of a cohort with multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome (MCAHS)...  
Collecting clinical information of 17 patients with pathogenic variants in PIGN, PIGA, and PIGT...  
Fifteen variants from seven patients were identified with PIGN mutations… case 4 had 3 mutations...  
Five PIGT variants were identified in two sporadic patients… case 16 carried 3 mutations…  
Seven different hemizygous PIGA mutations… among eight patients… Seven of the mutations were inherited from their mothers, and only one was de novo."

Chain-of-thought:
- The study tested 17 probands.
- 7 PIGN cases and 2 PIGT cases have compound mutations (some with 3 variants).
- That gives 9 compound heterozygotes.
- 8 PIGA cases with hemizygous mutations → single variants inherited from heterozygous mothers → count as positive HET probands.
- The paper's title and cohort definition give clear shared phenotype: "Multiple Congenital Anomalies-Hypotonia-Seizures Syndrome".

Expected output:
- Number of probands tested: 17  
- Number of positive HET probands: 8  
- Number of compound/double heterozygotes: 9  
- Positive proband phenotype(s): Multiple Congenital Anomalies-Hypotonia-Seizures Syndrome
