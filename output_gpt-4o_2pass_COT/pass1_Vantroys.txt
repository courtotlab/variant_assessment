## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability..."

INFERRED: No additional inferred information suggesting more than one proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not specify if the proband is heterozygous for a single pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability"

INFERRED: "severe progressive encephalopathy," "epileptic seizure," "acute liver failure," "mild dysmorphic facial features"

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A > T, p. Lys313Met)." 

This indicates the presence of compound heterozygous mutations.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The same fractions were prepared from liver from the proband and controls."

INFERRED: The detailed case report and the use of "the proband" suggest a single individual was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not specify if the proband is heterozygous for a single pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband was born at term from non-consanguineous parents. Antenatal ultrasound examination revealed intra-uterine growth retardation."

INFERRED: The proband exhibited "severe axial hypotonia, hypertonia and dystonic posturing of arms and legs," "slight dysmorphic features," "severe delay of cognitive and motor development," "optic atrophy," "acute liver failure (ALF) and metabolic encephalopathy," and "severe generalized amyotrophy."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "This filtering strategy resulted in two compound heterozygous variants in the WARS2 gene (NM_015836)."

This indicates the presence of compound heterozygous mutations in the proband.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report on a 6-year-old child with WARS2 deficiency."

INFERRED: The use of "the proband" and detailed case description suggest a single individual was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not specify if the proband is heterozygous for a single pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proposita had presented at young age with developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability."

INFERRED: "seizures," "acute liver failure," "severe encephalopathy," "deteriorated rapidly," "became progressively more unconscious and died half a year later."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "A third primer pair was designed to confirm compound heterozygosity."

This indicates the presence of compound heterozygous mutations in the proband.

## Pages 7-8 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "In the subject reported here, microscopic examination of liver showed a mosaic pattern after activity staining of cytochrome c oxidase."

INFERRED: The repeated use of "the subject" and "the proband" throughout the text suggests that only one individual was tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not specify if the proband is heterozygous for a single pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Epilepsy, ptosis, hypoglycaemia, valproate induced hepatotoxicity"

INFERRED: The proband also exhibited "atrophy most prominent in the frontal regions and, in addition, atrophy of the vermis cerebelli, brainstem and cerebellar peduncles."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The identical compound heterozygous mutant genotype (p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ p.Lys313Met) was found in the two subjects with severe neonatal expression reported by Wortmann et al."

This indicates the presence of compound heterozygous mutations in the proband.
