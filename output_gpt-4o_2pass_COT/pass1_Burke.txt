## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp)..."

INFERRED: No additional inferred information suggesting more than one proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text only mentions a compound heterozygous case.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp) who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp)..."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was the first and only child born to non-consanguineous parents of European descent with no relevant family history."

INFERRED: The text consistently refers to "the patient," suggesting a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text only mentions a compound heterozygous case.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Early development was normal until the age of 1 when he was first noted to have left leg tremor while learning to stand."

EXPLICIT: "At 18 months, the left leg tremor spread to his right leg and he was noted to have expressive language delay despite good receptive language skills."

EXPLICIT: "By 23 months, tremor had also become apparent in the upper extremities along with intermittent dystonic posturing of all extremities."

EXPLICIT: "The patient was evaluated at the NIH at age 9 and had advanced Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism with prominent and unpredictable 'on-off' fluctuations, peak-dose dyskinesia, stooped posture and disabling off-dystonia."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Specifically, the patient was compound heterozygous for 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_015836.3): a missense variant c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly) that was inherited from his mother and a missense variant c.683C>G (p.Ser228Trp) that was inherited from his father."

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: No additional explicit information found.

INFERRED: The text refers to "the patient" and "our patient," suggesting a single proband was tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text only mentions a compound heterozygous case.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 and a clinical presentation of infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism."

INFERRED: The text discusses the patient's clinical progression, which "has followed the prototypical course of adult idiopathic PD," and mentions "early 'honeymoon' response to Levodopa supplementation," "severe motor fluctuation," and "need for DBS at age 10 to achieve control of motor complications."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we present a fourth patient with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2..."

INFERRED: The text refers to "compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2" and discusses the inheritance of two different mutations from the patient's parents, indicating a compound heterozygous case.
