## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) scheduled for correction of the inner nose."

INFERRED: "The patient" suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found. The text does not mention any probands who were heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

No relevant information found. The text does not provide specific clinical phenotypes associated with positive heterozygotes.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "The patient" suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

No relevant information found. The text does not provide specific clinical phenotypes associated with positive heterozygotes.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations." 

EXPLICIT: "One brother has the same genotype as the patient," indicating he is also compound heterozygous.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: "our patient" suggests a single proband.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "heterozygous mutation G3A. This mutation, Gly115Asp, is present in the mother and the three sons (striped area)."

EXPLICIT: "Double peaks (C and T nucleotides; arrow) indicating heterozygous mutation, C3T. This mutation (Gln172STOP) is present in the father and two sons (black area in the pedigree)."

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

No relevant information found. The text does not provide specific clinical phenotypes associated with positive heterozygotes.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "the patient was compound heterozygous for two silent mutations."

EXPLICIT: "One brother has the same genotype as the patient," indicating he is also compound heterozygous.
