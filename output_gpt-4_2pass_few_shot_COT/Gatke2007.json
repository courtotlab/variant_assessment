    "num_tested_probands": "As the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established with certainty using conventional biochemical tests, DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives.",
    "num_positive_het_probands": "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126. The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M. The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126.",
    "positive_phenotypes": "Hereditary low BChE activity may result in an extensively prolonged duration of action of these drugs, especially in patients who are homozygous for the atypical or silent variants. In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine.",
    "num_compound_or_double_hets": "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."
