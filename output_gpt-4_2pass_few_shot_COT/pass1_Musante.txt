## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

INFERRED: The text mentions "two Iranian families affected by ARID" and "The probands were examined by experienced clinical geneticists who assessed their physical and mental status." This suggests that at least two probands were tested, one from each family.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of heterozygous probands. However, it mentions a "compound heterozygous genotype" in the second family, which suggests that at least one proband in this family is heterozygous.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "In the first family, homozygosity mapping in combination with subsequent mutation screening revealed a homozygous missense mutation in the Seryl-tRNA Synthetase (SARS) gene (MIM# 607529), which co-segregates with moderate ID, microcephaly, ataxia, speech impairment, and aggressive behavior."

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "In the second family, we found compound DNA-alterations affecting the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene (MIM# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and could show that both co-segregate with moderate ID, ataxia, speech impairment, microcephaly, and aggressive behavior."

INFERRED: The text does not explicitly state the number of compound/double heterozygotes. However, it mentions a "compound heterozygous genotype" in the second family, which suggests that at least one proband in this family is a compound/double heterozygote.

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Family 2 was part of a large study of the molecular basis of ARID and genotyping results of six DNA samples (IV:2, IV:3, V:2, V:7, V:8, V:9) from this family were used for homozygosity mapping and multipoint parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis."

INFERRED: The table lists six individuals from two families, suggesting that six probands were tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The table shows that two individuals (Family 2-V:7 and Family 2-V:8) have two different mutations in the WARS2 gene, suggesting they are compound heterozygotes. However, the text does not explicitly state that these individuals are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: The table lists clinical features for each individual, including gender, parental consanguinity, ethnic origin, birth details, growth parameters, facial features, psychomotor development, ataxia, muscle weakness, seizure, behavior problems, speech impairment, intellectual disability, and other anomalies.

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

INFERRED: The table shows that two individuals (Family 2-V:7 and Family 2-V:8) have two different mutations in the WARS2 gene, suggesting they are compound heterozygotes. However, the text does not explicitly state the number of compound/double heterozygotes.

## Pages 5-6 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Family 1 is an Iranian family with Arabian ethnicity. The distantly related parents had nine children, four of them presented with ID; the pedigree is shown in Figure 1A."

EXPLICIT: "Family 2 is an Iranian family from the Semnan province of Iran. The consanguineous healthy parents had nine children, three of them with ID (Fig. 1B)."

INFERRED: The text mentions two families with a total of seven individuals presenting with ID, suggesting that seven probands were tested in this study.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "All affected children were born at full term after uneventful pregnancies, followed by a normal neonatal period. Testing of cognitive function using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) showed an intelligence quotient (IQ) 40–45 in the range of moderate ID, speech impairment (slow and slurred speech) and aggressive behavior. In addition, the patients presented with microcephaly, ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years), and muscular weakness (since the age of 6–10). All patients developed tonic–clonic seizures during infancy, which are well controlled by sodium valproate."

EXPLICIT: "Two affected siblings (V:7 and V:8) presented with moderate ID (IQ = 41–46), athetosis, aggressive behavior, and speech impairment (slow and slurred speech). Moreover muscular weakness and ataxia (unbalanced gait starting at the age of 7–10 years) were observed."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

No relevant information found.
