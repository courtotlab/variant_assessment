## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp) who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text mentions a single case of a boy with compound heterozygous mutations, implying that there is one proband who is heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp) who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp) who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was the first and only child born to non-consanguineous parents of European descent with no relevant family history."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text mentions a single case of a boy with compound heterozygous mutations, implying that there is one proband who is heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Early development was normal until the age of 1 when he was first noted to have left leg tremor while learning to stand. At 18 months, the left leg tremor spread to his right leg and he was noted to have expressive language delay despite good receptive language skills. By 23 months, tremor had also become apparent in the upper extremities along with intermittent dystonic posturing of all extremities."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Specifically, the patient was compound heterozygous for 2 variants in WARS2 (NM_015836.3): a missense variant c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly) that was inherited from his mother and a missense variant c.683C>G (p.Ser228Trp) that was inherited from his father."
