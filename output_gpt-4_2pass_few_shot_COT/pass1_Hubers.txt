1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "Here, we further increase the knowledge on the clinical presentation of WARS2 deﬁciency by presenting the first case with a clinically prominent hyperkinetic movement disorder with dystonia, chorea, and ballism."

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text mentions "biallelic variants in WARS2" in the patient, suggesting that both alleles are mutated. This implies that the patient is not heterozygous for a pathogenic variant.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "A severe hyperkinetic movement disorder with uncontrollable ballistic and dystonic movements." and "a clinical phenotype consisting of a severe hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive deficits."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "Here we present a patient with biallelic variants in WARS2." This suggests that the patient has two different mutations, one on each allele, making him a compound heterozygote.
