## Pages 1-2 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man"

2. Number of positive HET probands:

No relevant information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was compound heterozygous for silent mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene."

## Pages 3-4 ##
1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "The patient was a healthy 30-yr-old man"

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: "The biochemical data indicate that the patient and one brother are homozygous for silent mutations, whereas the father, the mother, and the other brother are heterozygous for a silent mutation." This suggests that the father, mother, and one brother are heterozygous, but it is not clear if they are probands.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The patient’s BChE activity was zero, indicating that he was homozygous for silent mutations."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The patient is compound heterozygous for two silent mutations." "One brother has the same genotype as the patient," This suggests there are two compound heterozygotes.
