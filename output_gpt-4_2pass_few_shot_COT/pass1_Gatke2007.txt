1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: "As the phenotypes of the three probands could not be established with certainty using conventional biochemical tests, DNA samples were collected from two of the probands and four relatives."

INFERRED: The text mentions three probands, suggesting that three probands were tested.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

INFERRED: The text mentions that "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126" and "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M." However, it is not explicitly stated that these are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant. The proband in family 2 was not sequenced, but a relative was heterozygous for BCHE*FS126. This suggests that there may be at least one positive HET proband, but it is not explicitly confirmed.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "Hereditary low BChE activity may result in an extensively prolonged duration of action of these drugs, especially in patients who are homozygous for the atypical or silent variants." and "In both patients, BChE activity was below detection limit, and they experienced an extensively prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine."

4. Number of compound/double heterozygotes:

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 3 was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M."

INFERRED: The text mentions that "The proband in family 1 was genotyped as BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126," which could suggest that this proband is also a compound heterozygote, but it is not explicitly confirmed.

1. Number of probands tested:

EXPLICIT: No new explicit quotes found.

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

2. Number of positive HET probands:

EXPLICIT: "One patient with a low BChE activity was genotyped as heterozygous for BCHE*FS126 (Table 1, patient 2–3)."

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.

3. Positive proband phenotype(s):

EXPLICIT: "The proband in family 1 (Fig. 1, patient 1–2) had the genotype BCHE*115D*I3E4-14C/BCHE*FS126 and displayed prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine resulting in 3 hours of apnoea and hence postoperative artificial ventilation at the intensive care unit." and "The proband in family 3 (Table 1, patient 3) was compound heterozygous for BCHE*328D and BCHE*142M, the latter mutation also known as the H-variant. BChE activity was below detection limit, and the patient had experienced a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine of 90 min, which is six times the normal duration."

INFERRED: No new inferred information found.
